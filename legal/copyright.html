<h1 align="center">ICU Copyrights</h1>
<p>The ICU project files contain code with several kinds of copyrights. They fall into several categories:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Copyright &lt;date&gt; IBM and others<br>
  </i>This is the standard copyright notice that was specified by the IBM Public License. All IBM-developed code in ICU4C and ICU4J will contain this notice.
  In the vast majority of cases &mdash; even where they say &quot;and others&quot;
  &mdash; files do not actually have any other
  contributions other than from IBM. See <a href="contributions/code_contributions.html">Code Contributions</a>.
  <p><i>Copyright &lt;date&gt; &lt;contributor&gt; and others<br>
  </i>Outside developers or companies who are allowed to contribute code to ICU may have their own copyright statements. However, all material contributions are covered by a
  copyright agreement. See <a href="contributions/code_contributions.html">Code Contributions</a>.
  <p><i>Copyright &lt;date&gt; Free Software Foundation<br>
  </i>ICU4C (not ICU4J) contains three build scripts with FSF copyrights: <code>configure</code>, <code>config.sub</code>, and <code>config.guess</code>. This often causes confusion, because
  most FSF code is covered by the GNU license, which is viral. These three files, however, contain explicit statements that they are not covered by the GPL
  when distributed as part of other projects, and that they may be redistributed
  under other licenses.&nbsp; For details, see <a href="#FSF">FSF</a>.
  <p><i>Copyright &lt;date&gt; Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br>
  </i>ICU4C (not ICU4J) contains one file, <code>install-sh</code>, with an MIT copyright. However, the file includes an explicit header saying that it can be redistributed without fee. For
  details, see <a href="#MIT">MIT</a>.
  <h3>Data Files</h3>
  <p><i># Copyright (c) &lt;date&gt; Unicode, Inc.<br>
  </i>As of Unicode 4.0.1, the license terms have been made more explicit on the files that we redistribute from the Unicode Character Database. This permitted is under the terms
  of the license. For details, see <a href="#UCD">UCD</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Details">Details</a></h2>
<p>Note: The text in <code>typewriter style</code> (mostly with a # character at
the beginning of the lines) directly under filename links is quoted directly
from those files. It shows the full copyright information from those files.</p>
<h3>A. <a name="FSF">Free Software Foundation</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><u>Applies to ICU4C. Does not apply to ICU4J.</u></p>
  <p>The statements for two of the files under &quot;Free Software Foundation&quot; are the following. Note that we do &quot;<i>distribute
  this file as part of a program that contains a configuration script generated by
  Autoconf</i>&quot; and therefore we &quot;include it under the same
  distribution terms that you use for the rest of that program&quot; (see bold
  quoted text below).</p>
  <p>Further details: Development of C/C++ code that is portable across a large
  number of platforms and compilers requires adaptation to the many differences
  between them. The Autoconf tool achieves this for ICU and for many other
  development projects. It needs these script files in order to function. The
  files themselves, as published by their authors and quoted below, contain an
  exception to the GPL that allows commercial (non-GPL) software development
  using these files. The exception requires the distribution of the files. These
  files are part of the build setup, not part of the library source code.
  Shipping build files is only relevant for source downloads. ICU4C fulfills the
  condition by including the required files in its source download.</p>
  <p>These files are not used for Java development and therefore do not apply to
  ICU4J.</p>
