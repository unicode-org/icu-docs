Agenda items:

1. ICU 1.7 Release
  The ICU 1.7 release is ready to go with a final CVS tag today or early tomorrow
  and .zip/.tar/API docs online tomorrow

2. Lotus: collation data variants
  - ICU is being integrated into the next major release of Lotus Notes
  - Lotus adding collation data
  - Lotus/ICU working together on better Japanese dictionary sort
  - ICU 1.8 shall meet requirements
  - need UCA compliance
  - need to coordinate about regional variants

  - RealNames is not using collation
  - Mark: we are comparing collation results between ICU and Windows/MS Office
  - All details of collation design online in design document
  - Since taylored collation rules concentrate on letters, and our collation data is
    largely the same as UCA for letters, we do not expect big differences for common sorting cases

  - Other collation data sources: IBM "Green Book", locale repository, ICU, Java, Microsoft, ...
  - Mark: "no particular aura of invincibility for the Green Book"

  - Lotus: probably need two collations for German (dictionary/phone book)
  - Normal jitterbug for missing data? Include link to data (or data directly for short rules)

  - Hungarian has special wide/slender rules - Lotus will submit specifics to the mailing list
  - Mark: will have a switch for handling spaces as fourth-order differences,
    will handle Arabic Kashida(?!)
  - Mark: Could have API to set filter function for special cases,
    manipulating the incoming text stream (not the intermediate collation element stream)
  - Some collation libraries have special options like Win32:
    "ignore leading symbols", Lotus: ignore dash/single quote, ...

3. Lotus: mapping files for non-IBM codepages
  - ibm-5353 is not compatible with (the current) windows-1257 -
    need to verify non-IBM codepage mapping tables
    (and needs IBM-internal discussion about keeping track of non-IBM codepages in general)
  - Microsoft mapping tables generated early in 2000 on Windows 2000 (pre-sp1)
    are available on the public ICU site

4. Next meeting: Wednesday, 2001-jan-10, 10am PST/1pm EST
