<title>Multiple resource trees for ICU data</title>

<h1>Ideas for multiple resource trees for ICU data</h1>
<p>ICU has one &quot;tree&quot; for locale data, i.e., each locale resource
bundle has a name consisting of only the locale ID, so that we cannot
distinguish between a &quot;de&quot; bundle for collation and a &quot;de&quot;
bundle for RBNF (RuleBasedNumberFormat), for example.</p>
<p>Our data loading APIs (udata.h) and resource bundle APIs (ures.h) and similar
take essentially two parameters for the naming, with a third mostly implied:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A &quot;path/basename&quot; string. It gets separated internally into a
    filesystem path part (ending with the last / or \ depending on the platform)
    and a &quot;basename&quot; part that is the name of the package (DLL or .dat
    file containing multiple ICU data files).</li>
  <li>A &quot;name&quot; which is the locale ID for resource bundles, the
    conversion table/charset name, etc.</li>
  <li>A &quot;type&quot; which is effectively the filename suffix; &quot;res&quot;
    for resource bundles, &quot;cnv&quot; for conversion tables, &quot;icu&quot;
    for miscellaneous files, &quot;brk&quot; for break iterator files...</li>
</ol>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We leave the APIs unchanged syntactically and parse
another separator in the &quot;basename&quot; part of the &quot;path/basename&quot;
parameter. We separate the &quot;basename&quot; into a
&quot;package name&quot; and a &quot;tree name&quot; with a dash (hyphen '-').
We do this inside the generic udata_ API (as opposed to only in resource
bundle code) so that we can (potentially) have multiple &quot;trees&quot; not
just for resource bundles but also for other kinds of data (e.g., with an EBCDIC
&quot;tree&quot; for conversion).</p>
<p>Nested &quot;subtrees&quot; are separated with further dashes.</p>
<p>We currently prepend the package name to the filenames of binary files. In
order to not use extremely long filenames, and to better show the data
organization, we will replace this by organizing binary files into folders; the
top folder will have the package's name, and nested subfolders will have the
tree and subtree names. Similarly, source filenames will not get the tree name(s)
prepended, but will be placed in separate folders. Source file folders need not
be organized along the same structure though.</p>
<p>Using folders like this probably means that most of our data build tools
(e.g., genrb) need not be modified. The makefiles specify the appropriate source
and destination folders, and not give a package name to the build tools.
Dependencies of binary output files on text input files can be simplified
because the file basenames now match, without package name prefixes.</p>
<p>For example, source/data/locales/de.txt will be split, and the collation part
of it will be put into a de.txt in a new folder, e.g., in
source/data/locales/collation/ or in source/data/collation/ genrb will be called
with the fully specified source and destination folder names but without the
package name parameter, and will generate source/data/out/icudt26l/de.res for
the file with the remaining localizations and
source/data/out/icudt26l/collation/de.res for the collation file. Note that this
replaces the current source/data/out/build/ folder with a
source/data/out/icudt26l/ folder to cut one hierarchy level.</p>
<p>Index files, which we currently use for uloc_getAvailable(), will be
generated per tree and used in the appropriate service APIs like
ucol_getAvailable(). This is an improvement in the accuracy of the getAvailable()
information. In the future, as a separate work item, we may introduce runtime
enumeration of package entries and of filesystem files to make this more
dynamic.</p>
<h2>Data loading</h2>
<p>Currently, data loading roughly works as follows - the first location where
we find the data wins (looking for a package uses a package cache before looking
in the paths):</p>
<ul>
  <li>We extract the requested path from the path/basename and prepend it to the
    multiple-path list that is set for ICU.</li>
  <li>Take the basename as the package name.</li>
  <li>Look for the single file package_name.type in the multiple paths.</li>
  <li>Look for the package &quot;package&quot;, in there look for the entry
    package_name.type.</li>
</ul>
<p>For ICU, the package name defaults to something like icudt26l where
&quot;26&quot; is the ICU version and &quot;l&quot; is for little-endian data
(&quot;b&quot; and &quot;e&quot; for other platforms, &quot;e&quot; for big-endian
EBCDIC).</p>
<p>With the above additional &quot;tree name(s)&quot;, this should change to</p>
<ul>
  <li>We extract the requested path from the path/basename and prepend it to the
    multiple-path list that is set for ICU.</li>
  <li>Separate the basename (package-tree-subtree, if there is at least one '-') into the package
    name and tree name(s).</li>
  <li>If there is no '-' in the basename, then there is no tree name, just a package
    name.</li>
  <li>Look for the single file package/tree/subtree/name.type in the multiple paths.<br>
    (For single files, the package-name-folder is not mentioned in the global
    path setting but generated as part of the item lookup. For example, if the
    path contains &quot;/usr/markus/&quot; then the data loader will try to load
    &quot;/usr/markus/icudt26l/collation/de.res&quot;.)</li>
  <li>Look for the package &quot;package_tree_subtree&quot;, in there look for the entry
    package/tree/subtree/name.type.</li>
  <li>Look for the package &quot;package_tree&quot;, in there look for the entry
    package/tree/subtree/name.type.</li>
  <li>Look for the package &quot;package&quot;, in there look for the entry
    package/tree/subtree/name.type.</li>
</ul>
<p>This not only allows us to distinguish between multiple &quot;de&quot; files
for different trees, but also to have separate .dat files, one per tree (&amp;
subtree).</p>
<p>For example, we could have a &quot;collation&quot; tree for collation, an &quot;rbnf&quot;
tree for RuleBasedNumberFormat, a &quot;calendar&quot; tree for calendar data and
date/time formats, ... The important thing is that we need at least a tree for
each &quot;service&quot; so that we can report usable information for what
locale IDs are actually implemented (ucol_getAvailable() and
fallback/using-default conditions). Further subdivisions are possible if they
don't get in the way of this mechanism and help with modularization.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This replaces the underscore in old file and entry names with a slash. It
    must be possible to load old files, at least from packages. It would be good
    to also support the old single-item filename with an underscore if there is
    no tree name.</li>
  <li>The formatVersion in the UDataInfo of the .dat files will indicate the
    format change. If DLL packages do not yet have a UDataInfo header (with
    magic bytes), then one must be added.</li>
  <li>Entry names always use forward slashes '/' while filenames should continue
    to use the platform-specific file separator ('\' on Windows).</li>
  <li>The build-time .obj files are compiled from temporary C source code like
    icudt26l_de_res.c (in the future, icudt26l/collation/de_res.c). They contained C data export names like
    &quot;icudt26l_de_res&quot;. genccode (the tool that generates these files) and gencmn (the tool that generates the ToC)
    must continue to generate C-syntax-friendly export names like
    &quot;icudt26l_collation_de_res&quot;. All characters that are not A-Za-z0-9 need to be turned into _ underscores.
    Package and tree/subtree names must be prepended. Again, this is for the .obj
    symbols, while the ToC entry strings will be &quot;icudt26l/collation/de.res&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we wanted separate (sub)trees for subsets of conversion tables, then we would need to think about
how we express them in the alias table (convrtrs.txt) so that from the lookup
result we know the tree or subtree. The tree would not be part of the charset name matching, which
might require some code and/or data structure adjustments. For
example:</p>
<pre><font FACE="Helv" SIZE="2"># table in the default tree
ibm-5348 aliases...
# table in the EBCDIC tree
ebcdic/ibm-1140 aliases...</pre>
</font>
