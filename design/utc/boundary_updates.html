<p>UAX #14 and #29 describe rules for detecting boundaries between text segments. As with all 
Unicode algorithms, implementations just need to get the same results; they don't have to follow the 
architecture. And for efficiency, most implementations use different mechanisms.</p>
<p>In CLDR, we recently introduced structure for tailoring boundaries. In so doing, we followed the 
rule structure of those UAXs as much as possible. One good advantage of that is that we now have 
monkey tests that can compare an implementation against an implementation that follows the rules 
precisely. That allows implementations to avoid gratuitous deviations.</p>
<p>However, we found a few problems in the rules themselves. This document proposes some changes in 
response.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In particular, the rules &quot;treat X as Y&quot; turn out to be difficult to exactly interpret precisely, 
and exposed a few edge cases. Take the following rules from Word boundaries:</p>
<table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="4" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="right" colSpan="4">
    <p align="left"><i>Treat a grapheme cluster as if it were a single character: the first 
    character of the cluster. Do not break within it.</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <p class="right" align="right">GC</td>
    <td align="right">
    <p class="center">&#8594;</td>
    <td align="right">FC</td>
    <td class="right">(3)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colSpan="4">
    <p align="left"><i>Ignore <span class="old_changed">trailing</span> Format characters. That is, 
    ignore Format characters in all subsequent rules (except the last rule).</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="right">X Format*</td>
    <td class="center">&#8594;</td>
    <td>X</td>
    <td class="right">(4)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="4" border="2" align="right" width="40%" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1em">
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top" colspan="2"><i>To remind people, Format and Extend characters are:</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top"><b><a name="Format">Format</a></b></td>
    <td>General_Category = Format (Cf) minus Joiner, Non-Joiner</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td vAlign="top"><a name="Format"><b>Extend</b></a></td>
    <td>Me + Mn + Joiner, Non-Joiner, plus a few exceptional Mc characters:<pre>09BE BENGALI VOWEL SIGN AA
09D7 BENGALI AU LENGTH MARK
...</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Grapheme clusters do 3 things. They keep (a) CRLF together; they keep (b) Hangul syllables 
together; and keep (c) non-spacing sequences together with their bases (more exactly, Extend 
characters with their bases). </p>
<p>If the rules for the boundary conditions would otherwise keep Hangul syllables together (as is 
the case for our Word, Line, and Sentence breaks, then (3) is equivalent to </p>
<p>3a) CR × LF</p>
<p>3b) X Extend* -&gt; X. </p>
<h2>1 Separating Grapheme Cluster Rule into two</h2>
<p>Line break already separates these out (and modifies its version of 3b). After looking at the 
interactions of these with other rules, we think that is the better approach in #29 also. It tends 
to expose some edge cases so that we can make the resolution clearer, as we will see below.</p>
<h2>2 Adding × $Extend</h2>
<p>Section 6.2 explains how the rule <i>X Extend* -&gt; X</i> is to be interpreted (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_and_Format_Rules">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_and_Format_Rules</a>). 
That is, in every subsequent rule, change each instance of X (where X is <i>any</i> type except the 
last after the break) into X Extend*. Thus:</p>
<p align="center"><span class="example2">X Y × Z W</span></p>
<p align="center"><span class="example2">becomes &nbsp;</span></p>
<p align="center"><span class="example2">X <u>Extend*</u> Y <u>Extend*</u> × Z <u>Extend*</u> W&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It need to also mention that it logically also includes the rule:</p>
<p>× $Extend</p>
<p>That is, that you don't allow breaking within such sequences (in rules after the 'treat as' 
rule). So this section of the text needs to be enhanced.</p>
<h2>3 Ignoring Format &amp; Extend consistently</h2>
<p>In Word Break, we would then have the following rules:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3a) CR × LF<br>
  3b) X Extend* -&gt; X<br>
  4) X Format* -&gt; X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an implementation according to section 6.2, rules 3b and 4 turn into the following rules, <i>
and</i> turns each X in subsequent rules into (X Extend* Format*). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3b*) × $Extend<br>
  4*) × $Format</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, that means that extend and format characters are not completely ignorable. If you insert 
a format character <i>between</i> a character and an Extend character, it introduces a break into a 
word that had none, or if you insert an Extend character <i>after</i> a Format character, it also 
introduces a break into a word that had none. This seems counter-intuitive. Our recommendation is to 
combine these two rules into a new 4':</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>4') X (Extend | Format)* -&gt; X</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which essentially ignores both Extend and Format characters in words, wherever they occur. While 
this change is not necessary in Sentence break (since the default action is to keep characters 
together rather than break them apart), for parallelism we should make the change there too (it 
doesn't hurt anything).</p>
<h2>4 Properly Breaking after Sep</h2>
<p>Sentence break has the following rules:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="4" border="0">
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="4">
      <p align="left"><i>Break after paragraph separators.</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="right" align="right">Sep</td>
      <td class="center">÷</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="right">(3)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="right" colSpan="4">
      <p align="left"><i>Treat a grapheme cluster as if it were a single character: the first 
      character of the cluster. Do not break within it.</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p class="right" align="right">GC</td>
      <td align="right">
      <p class="center">&#8594;</td>
      <td align="right">FC</td>
      <td class="right">(4)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="4">
      <p align="left"><i>Ignore <span class="old_changed">trailing</span> Format characters. That 
      is, ignore Format characters in all subsequent rules.</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="right">X Format*</td>
      <td class="center">&#8594;</td>
      <td>X</td>
      <td class="right">(5)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have broken down what GC-&gt;FC means, it is clear that this is an error, since it would 
break between CR and LF (both being members of Sep). Since we have separated out the CRLF rule 
above, now fixing this becomes easy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3a) CR × LF<br>
  3b') Sep ÷<br>
  4') X (Extend | Format)* -&gt; X</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>5 Fixing flaw in termination</h2>
<p>Sentence break currently has the following rules. These are to capture the rule that you break 
after (but not within) the expression (( STerm | ATerm ) Close* Sp* Sep?), that is: a terminator, 
followed by optionally any number of close punctuation characters, followed optionally by any number 
of space characters, followed optionally by a paragraph separator character.</p>
<blockquote>
  <table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="4" border="0">
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="4">
      <p align="left"><i>Break after sentence terminators, but include closing punctuation, trailing 
      spaces, and (optionally) a paragraph separator.</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="right">( STerm | ATerm ) Close*</td>
      <td class="center">×</td>
      <td>( Close | Sp | Sep )</td>
      <td class="right">(9)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="right">( STerm | ATerm ) Close* Sp</td>
      <td class="center">×</td>
      <td>( Sp | Sep )</td>
      <td class="right">(10)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="right">( STerm | ATerm ) Close* Sp*</td>
      <td class="center">÷</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="right">(11)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the goal is to allow any number of Space characters, rule 10 needs a fix:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>10)&nbsp; ( STerm | ATerm ) Close* Sp<u><b>*</b></u> × ( Sp | Sep )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And rule 11 needs to allow for Sep in the final case, so rule 11 needs to be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>11) ( STerm | ATerm ) Close* Sp* <u><b>Sep?</b></u> ÷</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>6 User Character</h2>
<p>The editorial committee recommends changing 'user character' to 'user-perceived character' in 
analogy / contrast to 'user-defined character'. This requires edits to UAX#29 and perhaps other 
places.</p>
<h2>7 Linebreak Defaults</h2>
<p>Linebreak has:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>LB 1&nbsp; Assign a line breaking class to each code point of the input. Resolve
  <a class="charclass" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/#AI">AI</a>,
  <a class="charclass" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/#CB">CB</a>,
  <a class="charclass" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/#SA">SA</a>,
  <a class="charclass" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/#SG">SG</a>, and
  <a class="charclass" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/#XX">XX</a> into other line 
  breaking classes depending on criteria outside the scope of this algorithm.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fine and good, but if the implementation doesn't handle these specially, they need to 
have defaults; they must be resolved to something for the rest of the algorithm to work, since all 
but CB don't have rules associated with them. Right now, you have to go rooting around in the text 
to figure that out, and people may make mistakes in doing so. So add to this rule something like the 
following text:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>In the absence of such resolution, the classes AI, SA, SG, and XX have the value AL.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>8 Linebreak Numbers</h2>
<p>Currently, we have the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In general, lines should not be broken inside numbers of the form described by the following 
  regular expression:</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;<a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> ? ( <a class="charclass" href="#OP">OP</a> 
  | <a class="charclass" href="#HY">HY</a> ) ? <a class="charclass" href="#NU">NU</a> (<a class="charclass" href="#NU">NU</a> 
  | <a class="charclass" href="#SY">SY</a> | <a class="charclass" href="#IS">IS</a>) *
  <a class="charclass" href="#CL">CL</a> ?&nbsp; <a class="charclass" href="#PO">PO</a> ?</p>
  <p><i>Examples:&nbsp; </i>$(12.35)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,1234&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (12)¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  12.54¢</p>
  <p>The default line breaking algorithm approximates this with the following rule, together with
  <a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> × <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> and
  <a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> × <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a>, which handle 
  numeric prefix puncutation.&nbsp; Note that some cases are already handled above, like ‘9,’, ‘[9’. 
  For a tailoring that supports the regular expression directly, see Section 8.2,
  <a href="#Examples"><i>Examples of Customization</i></a>.</p>
  <p><i>LB 18&nbsp; Do not break between the following pairs of classes.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">CL × PO</p>
<p align="center">HY × NU</p>
<p align="center">IS × NU</p>
<p align="center">NU × NU</p>
<p align="center">NU × PO</p>
<p align="center"><u>PR × AL</u></p>
<p align="center">PR × HY</p>
<p align="center"><u>PR × ID</u></p>
<p align="center">PR × NU</p>
<p align="center">PR × OP</p>
<p align="center">SY × NU</p>
<p><i>This makes it actually a bit clumsy to customize, since </i><a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> 
× <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a> and <a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> ×
<a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a> are mixed in, even though they don't have anything to do with 
the numbers. Recommend removing those from rule 18, and moving them into a new rule 17b:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><i>17b. Do not break prefix signs (such as currency) from letters</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> × <a class="charclass" href="#AL">AL</a></p>
<p align="center"><a class="charclass" href="#PR">PR</a> × <a class="charclass" href="#ID">ID</a></p>
<p align="left">In the Customization Example 6, include precisely the syntax that 18 is replaced by.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><i><b>18* Do not break numbers</b></i></p>
</blockquote>
<div align="center">
  <center>

<h2>8 Rule Numbers</h2>
<p>To maintain rule numbers over versions, we have introduced notation like 18b, 18c,... In CLDR, it 
turned out to be easier to use decimal notation to refer to rules. The main advantage is that it 
allows for arbitrary insertion between existing numbers. Thus, if we had 18.1 and 18.2 (instead of 
18b and 18c), then we could later introduce 18.15, whereas we currently have no mechanism for 
inserting a new rule between 18b and 18c. We might think about that for the text as well.</p>
