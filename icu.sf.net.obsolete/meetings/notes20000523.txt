Brendan: Add the "Collation enhancements" to handle the following items,

    - Differences between system collator and other collation sequences.
  Having the ability to select variant collator based on the same
locale.  For example, The Korean sort sequence in ICU is different from
Lotus, e.g. Hanja.
    - Performance improvements to the 2-1 or 1-2 mapping sequences.
    - Collation versioning advanced implementation.

Helena: The milestones for 1.6 is tenatively set to the following,

6/24 API freeze for 1.6
6/29 API freeze snapshot deliverable for internal clients.
7/14 Implementation Complete for 1.6
7/21 Code Freeze for 1.6
7/25 FVT Exit for 1.6
7/31 Final Release Date for 1.6

- Technical discussion
     1. Locale biasing conversion interface.
         We all agreed the interface is acceptable.  The code changes
will be checked in today.
     2. icudata.dll export location.
        Agreement was reached to export data DLLs to the bin/ directory
on Windows.  However, the ICU_DATA environment variable can overwrite
that behavior.  Also, one can still set the data directory
programatically through API.
     3. UTF-16 update.
        All agreed that the UnicodeString usage in the single character
interface in the Format APIs is acceptable.  This item will be part of
the 1.5 release.  The single character APIs will be marked as
deprecated.

     4. IANA names structure.
         This discussion will be postponed until next meeting when Yves
and Mark can attend.

- Other agenda items
    NCR's lawyer is concerned with the 2nd paragraph of the general
section in IBM's public source-code license.  David and Helena will
update the team with feedback from lawyers on both sides when that's
available.
