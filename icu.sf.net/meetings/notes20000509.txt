    comments from today are marked with today's date.

- ICU 1.4.1.2 is ready to be released!

    This is an update to 1.4.0 and 1.4.1.1 for DB/2 which is starting to use
    the XML parser with ICU underneath.
    Some of the issues were correct default encoding names and default
    locales, as well as finding and loading ICU data, which prompted
    a modification of udata and, in the current code for 1.5, a rewrite.

- ICU 1.5 release milestones: (GA 6/7/2000)

    Currently scheduled items to be finished for the 1.5 development release:

    - Finish Bidi API implementation
    - Clean up callback API for converter
    - Add 3/4 byte encoding support,e.g. euc-jp
    - Complete charmap generation program on various platforms
    - Define locale data XML format spec
    - Provide integrated tools for data generation
    - Support IANA/MIME names (Yves?)
    - Complete RB/Collation data integration
    - Integrate MP-RAS port changes.
    - Complete upgrading to Unicode 3.0, Normailzation.
    - Provide basic collation versioning.
    - Complete transliterator rule syntax update.
    - Add basic UTF-16 support.
    - Timezone and formatter clean-up, especially Year-Week-Day handling.
    - Finish ICU User's Guide

    Release schedule:

    5/22 Implementation Complete
    5/26 Code Freeze (including unit tests)
    6/02 Test Exit
         (Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 9 as well as UTF-16 compatibility, etc.)
    6/7 Final Release Date

- Time for the agenda items that were added in the meeting

  + Jim sent an email this morning about opening a converter with a locale
    as parameter.

    Discussion:
    * Lotus needs to specify the locale at open time for the algorithmic
      LMBCS converter; this is also useful for ISO-2022-JP etc.
    * Steven pointed out that this would be useful for the other
      variants of ucnv_open() but that that means to add several such
      functions.
    * There should be a clone() function for converters so that one does not
      need to know the UConverter structure and memcpy it.
    * The original idea for the locale parameter in the internal open()
      functions was to use it for ISO-2022. The parameter was to be extracted
      from the canonical name in convrtrs.txt.
    * We discussed having a number of parameters as part of the converter
      name, which could then also be in the canonical name in convrtrs.txt.
      We need to design a syntax for this.
      Based on this, we do not need new ucnv_open() variants.

  + Codepage mapping table mailing list

    * Mark has started an email list hosted by unicode.org for discussing
      codepage mapping tables and related issues.
    * Several ICU members are signed up already or asked Mark in the meeting
      to sign them up.
    * We (Helena/Mark) have written a program for Win32 that uses the
      platform conversion APIs to write mapping tables that precisely
      reflect the platform mappings.

    *** Action for all! ***
    * We need others to port this to other platforms and to generate
      more such mapping tables.

  + Collation versioning

    * Agreement that the version number must be increased at least when
      the collation keys would change compared to the previous version.
    * A simple implementation for the upcoming release could just always
      return "1" or similar, until the collation actually does change.
    * We should generate a hash code during the compilation of the rules
      into a binary collation structure. This hash code needs to cover
      all rules.

  + Reimplementation of udata for 1.5

    * Due to continued problems in the DB/2 environment that had originally
      triggered the udata mechanism, the implementation was redone.
      Now there is no compile-time configuration between DLL loading and
      memory-mapping any more. Instead, both variants are always active.
      The build options only control the type of data file that is built.
    * Common data files are first attempted to be loaded from a DLL,
      then mapped as a single file. Extension is done only with single-data
      memory-mapped files, not single-data DLLs.
      DLLs may contain either a single entry point with the same structure
      as the flat, mappable common file, or per-data entry points as before.
      In the latter case, we are now also building a Table of Contents
      that differs from the one in the flat file: it needs to use pointers
      instead of offsets.
    * udata_setCommonData() is available and detects either type of ToC.
      It also auto-detects if the data is prepended by a double dummy
      as generated in the .c files from genccode for alignment control.
      The 1.4.1.2 implementation relies on the mapped-file ToC.

    *** Action for all! ***
    * Building the ICU data DLL is much faster if it is done via the flat
      common file by directly transforming that flat file into a .o (.obj)
      file and linking it. This is done by gencmn now for Win32.
      Some platforms use the ELF format and have a libelf.sl or similar
      that allows to write such files.
      Anyone who is interested in fast builds of data DLLs on non-Win32
      platforms needs to write code for the transformation of
      static const, read-only data into a .o file and add that code
      to gencmn.
