Agenda items:

- ICU ported to MacOS?
  Jim: Lotus working on building a .dat file on the Mac; there is a discussion about this on the mailing list.
    Lotus Notes is shipped for the Mac.
    What does it take to add a reference platform?
    This is an exploratory question.
  George: So far only occasional, personal porting efforts.
  Mark: Need to talk with our manager.
  Markus: Distinguish between porting to the Mac and making the Mac a
    reference platform (more frequent tests by the core team).
  Mark: There was a Mac port before the data loading was implemented; that is probably the biggest item.
    We need to note on the Web site that we welcome porting changes.

- 1.8 API freeze

  Jim: safeClone() forgotten in C++ BreakIterator, will add today. There is already a C++ Collator::safeClone().
    The C++ UnicodeConverter::safeClone() will be added as part of a C/C++ synchronization after 1.8.
  Markus: What more API changes are necessary for collation?
  Syn Wee: There was NULLORDER for the collation element iterator; there is now a new NO_MORE_CES.
  Vladimir: This is an internal constant.
  George: The UCA table is built only for little-endian machines right now. (Windows & Intel-Linux)
    This will have to be fixed, by checking in the builder or both versions of the file.
