Agenda items:

1. Release schedule
  - Markus apologizes that the public schedule (icu/develop/tasks.html)
    did not contain the exact dates
  - listed all the planned dates for 1.7 and 1.8
  - Tex: which ICU release to pick up for his XML parser support?
    Markus/Mark: ICU 1.7 is not a reference release, 1.8 is.
                 1.7 will have only collation performance enhancements,
                 not UCA compliance and other improvements.
                 Collation keys (sort keys) will be stable only beginning
                 with 1.8.
  - after the phone meeting: the dates are on the schedule page now

2. Collation Design
  - comprehensive design doc posted yesterday
  - please read and send comments
  - Jim: Are all ASCII graphic characters sorted the same in
         all locales?
    Mark: No, Swedish sorts u identical to v. Italian sorts
          i identical to j?

3. Tex/Progress still has licensing issues
  - Will follow up with Mark while Helena is out
