5. Optimizations of Break Iterator
    Andy: How to handle the optimizations of break iterator code?
    Deborah: one option is to make changes on top of 3.6.
    Long discussion on optimization techniques and implementation followed
    
    Decision: Accept Deborah's proposal
6.  Japanese Word Break changes
    Andy: Make the rule changes in 3.6.
    Markus: Seconds the proposal

7. CharsetDetector logical vs Visual
   Andy:
        Problems:
            1. CharsetDetector returns wrong value in Lang param
            2. CharsetDetector returns ISO-8859-8 for both logical & visual order codepages
            3. ICU charset conversion accepts both values IANA, 
               ISO-8859-8-i for logical & ISO-8859-8 for visual, and maps to logical order
    
    Long discussion followed.
    
    Decision:
            1. Fix CharsetDetector to return correct value in lang param
            2. Fix CharsetDetector to return ISO-8859-8 for visual order and ISO-8859-8-i for logical order
            3. Postpone to 3.8
