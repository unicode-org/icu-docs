    <h2>Character Set Mapping Tables</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>ICU provides character set conversion with mapping tables for a number
    of important codepages. The default tables are a subset of IBM's CDRA
    conversion table repository. Our <a
    href="http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/demo/converters">Converter
    Explorer</a> shows aliases and codepage charts for the default tables that
    are built into a standard ICU distribution.</p>

    <p>Conversions for most codepages are implemented differently on different
    platforms. We are providing here mapping tables from many different sources
    so that ICU users and others can use these tables to get the same
    conversion behavior as on the original platforms.</p>

    <p>The mapping tables and some of the source code to the tools that
    collected these tables are checked into a CVS repository which is available
    <a href="http://dev.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/charset/">via the web</a>. The
    table files are provided in two formats:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>.ucm files are ready for use with ICU. Their format is similar to
      that of UPMAP/UXMAP files from the CDRA repository. It is described in
      the <a href="/userguide/conversion-data.html">Conversion Data</a> chapter
      of the <a href="/userguide/">ICU User Guide</a>.</li>

      <li>.xml files are in the format described by <a
      href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/">Unicode Technical
      Report 22</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are unfamiliar with character sets, codepages and encodings you
    may want to read the <a
    href="http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/charsets/index.jsp">Coded
    Character Sets article</a> on the <a
    href="http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/index.jsp">IBM
    Globalization site</a>.</p>

    <p>If you would like to add one of these tables to your copy of ICU, you
    can use the <a href="/userguide/icudata.html#custom_data_library">Data
    Customization</a> section of ICU's User's Guide for more information on
    this topic.</p>

    <h3>Some analysis of the data</h3>

    <p>Here is the analysis of the collected charset mapping information
    created by some of our tools. Some of the aliases for the <a
    href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/">UTR #22 names</a> can
    be found in our <a
    href="http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/demo/converters">ICU Converter
    Explorer</a> and in the <a
    href="http://dev.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/icu/source/data/mappings/convrtrs.txt">
    ICU alias table</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="similar.html">Similar</a> conversion tables that have
      identical roundtrip mappings.</li>

      <li><a href="identicals.html">Identical</a> conversion tables that have
      identical roundtrip, fallback and reverse fallback mappings.</li>

      <li><a href="roundtripIndex.html">A detailed</a> comparison of all the
      conversion tables. This is a very large HTML file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How we collect the data</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>IBM CDRA mapping tables are converted from the CDRA RPMAP/TPMAP/UPMAP
      (or RXMAP etc.) files into .ucm files.</li>

      <li>.ucm files for other platforms are generated by using the conversion
      services of those platforms.</li>

      <li>.xml files are generated from .ucm files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes on mapping tables for stateful encodings</h3>

    <p>There are two main types of stateful encodings:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Simple bi-state encodings that typically change states with SI/SO ISO
      control codes. These are especially used with EBCDIC multi-byte
      codepages.</li>

      <li>Complex encodings following mostly the ISO 2022 model of changing
      states with escape sequences, SI/SO controls, and single-shift
      codes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The .ucm file format supports simple SI/SO-stateful encodings by
    specifying the codepage structure. Codepage byte sequences for the two
    states differ in lengths: Single-byte codes in the initial state and
    double-byte codes in the other state.</p>

    <p>We do not currently have mapping tables for more complex stateful
    encodings. We plan to provide them with one mapping table file per state,
    plus a file that lists the states with their invoking sequences and
    per-state mapping table names.</p>

    <p>The current .xml file format does not support any stateful
    encodings.</p>

    <h3>Note on GB 18030</h3>

    <p>Of the large number (1.1 million) of mappings defined by the GB 18030
    standard, only about 31000 mappings are listed explicitly. The .xml file
    contains the remaining mappings in &lt;range&gt; elements. The .ucm file
    leaves the affected characters unassigned and relies on the ICU converter
    (release 1.7 and up) to perform these mappings algorithmically.</p>
