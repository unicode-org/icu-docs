<h1>Universal Time Scale</h1>
<p>M. Davis, 2004-05-11</p>
<p>There are quite a few different conventions for binary datetime, depending on different platforms and protocols. Some of these have severe drawbacks. For example, people using
Unix time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970) think that they are safe until near the year 2038. But cases can and do arise where arithmetic manipulations causes serious problems. Consider
the computation of the average of two datetimes, for example: if one calculates them with <code>averageTime = (time1 + time2)/2</code>, there will be overflow even with dates
around the present. Moreover, even if these problems don't occur, there is the issue of conversion back and forth between different systems.</p>
<p>Binary datetimes differ in a number of ways: the datatype, the unit, and the epoch (origin). We'll refer to these as time scales. For example:</p>

<p>All of the above are start at 00:00 am (the earliest possible time on the day in question), and are assumed to be UTC. <b><font color="#FF0000">[TBD: verify the above table, and
add others where appropriate.]</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b>Computer times are not really UTC; they are &quot;floating&quot; UTC. That is, they usually assume exactly 86,400 seconds per day in calculations, but then adjust
  the current time to be synchronous with UTC. Because UTC has some days with a different number of seconds due to leap (intercalary) seconds, computer time scales drift off of UTC
  whenever calculating dates more than a year or two away from the present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ranges for different datatypes are given in the following table (all values in years). The range of years includes the entire range expressible with positive and negative
values of the datatype. The range of years for double is the range that would be allowed without losing precision to the corresponding unit.</p>

<p>The Unix time exhibits two of the main problems: it is not precise enough, and it does not have enough range. It is a signed value with origin at 1970. So with a range of 136
years, it extends back to Dec 1901 and up to Jan 2038.</p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>Pick a particular time scale as a universal 'pivot', and provide conversion functions to and from all other major time scales. That will allow for datetimes to be converted to
the pivot time, safely manipulated, and converted back to any other datetime time scale.</p>
<p>So what to use for this pivot? Java time has plenty of range, but cannot represent Windows datetimes without severe loss of precision. ICU4C time addresses this by using a
double that is otherwise equivalent to the Java time. However, there are disadvantages with doubles. They provide for much more graceful degradation in arithmetic operations. But
they only have 53 bits of accuracy, which means that they will lose precision when converting back and forth to ticks. What would really be nice would be a long double (80 bits --
64 bit mantissa), but that is not supported on most systems.</p>
<p>The Unix extended time uses a structure with two components: time in seconds and a fractional field (microseconds). However, this is clumsy, slow, and prone to error (you always
have to keep track of overflow and underflow in the fractional field). BigDecimal would allow for arbitrary precision and arbitrary range, but we would not want to use this as the
normal type, because it is slow and does not have a fixed size.</p>
<p>Because of these issues, we ended up concluding that the Windows datetime would be the best pivot. We will, however, use the full range allowed by the datatype, allowing for
datetimes back to 29,000 BC and up to 29,000 AD. This time scale is very fine grained, does not lose precision, and covers a range that will meet almost all requirements. It will
not handle the range that Java times would, but frankly, being able to handle dates before 29,000 BC or after 29,000 AD is of very limited interest. However, for those cases, we
can also allow conversion to an optional BigDecimal format that would have arbitrary precision and range.</p>
<p>We could have chosen something arbitrarily different. Using a unit of 1 nanosecond would seem more natural, but only gives a range of 290 years. 10 nanoseconds would supply
enough range, and be slightly more precise, but that does not seem to be worth being different from an existing time scale.</p>
<p>For ICU we would add a set of conversion functions, something like</p>
<pre><font color="#0000FF">// conversion to 'universal time scale'
</font>
udatetime UDateTime.from(double otherTime, Selector selector);
udatetime UDateTime.from(long otherTime, Selector selector);

BigDecimal UDateTime.BigDecimalFrom(double otherTime, Selector selector);
BigDecimal UDateTime.BigDecimalFrom(long otherTime, Selector selector);

<font color="#0000FF">// conversion from 'universal time scale'
</font>
double UDateTime.toDouble(double udatetime, Selector selector);
long UDateTime.toLong(double udatetime, Selector selector);

double UDateTime.toDouble(BigDecimal udatetime, Selector selector);
long UDateTime.toLong(BigDecimal udatetime, Selector selector);</pre>
<p><i>Example:</i></p>
<pre>udatetime x = UDateTime.from(otherTime, JAVA_TIME);</pre>
<p>The APIs would be adapted for Java, C++, and C. For Java and C++, UDateTime would be a real class; that would allow it to be formatted with a Formattable. For Java, udatetime
would be replaced by long, since it has no typedefs. Calendar would need to be updated to handle more precision, and have methods to convert to and from UDateTime, but the changes
would be small.</p>
<p>Selectors would be available for entries in Table 1. Actually, where possible we should have neutral names for the time scales, and the vendor-specific ones can be aliases. Thus
we can have GREGORIAN_DAYS be the main selector, with, say, DELPHI = GREGORIAN_DAYS as an alias.</p>
