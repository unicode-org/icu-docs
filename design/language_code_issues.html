<h1 align="center">Language Code Issues</h1>
<p align="center">M. Davis, 2003.04.10</p>
<p>The current situation with regards to language codes and locale codes is a a
bit of a mess. We are looking at migrating ICU to use RFC 3066 instead of ISO
639 alone, and find a number of problems. Our goal is to identify the language
codes and region codes used in practice in Windows and other platforms, and
account for any missing ones so that people can communicate locale information
correctly, without loss of data because of missing or mismatched language codes.
The issues that we turned up, or were pointed out to us by others, are of
interest not only for ICU but also to a broader audience.</p>
<p>In the body of this document, we will refer to a number of different
standards. Here are links to them:</p>

<h2><a name="Missing_Languages">Missing Languages</a></h2>
<p>The usual basis for a locale code is a combination of language code and
region code, sometimes augmented with variants. The language code could either
be drawn from ISO 639 or from RFC 3066, but there are problems with both. RFC
3066 codes are actually a superset of ISO 636 codes, with one of the following
formats:</p>
<p><b><a name="Current_RFC_3066_Formats">Current RFC 3066 Formats</a></b></p>
<ol>
  <li><i>&quot;i-&quot; &lt;iana_registered_code&gt;</i></li>
  <li><i>&quot;x-&quot; &lt;private_use_code&gt;</i></li>
  <li><i>&lt;iso_639_code&gt;</i></li>
  <li><i>&lt;iso_639_code&gt; &quot;-&quot; &lt;iso_3166_code&gt;</i></li>
</ol>
<p>The possible formats are a bit broader than this, but these are the only
important ones in practice.</p>
<p>As far as we are concerned — <i>as a completely practical matter</i> —
two languages are different if they require substantially different localized
resources. Distinctions according to spoken form are important in some contexts,
but the written form is <i>by far and away</i> the most important issue for data
interchange. Unfortunately, this is not the principle used in ISO 639, which has
the fairly unproductive notion that only spoken language matters (it is also not
completely consistent about this, however). If the use of languages happens to
correspond to region boundaries expressed as ISO 639 country codes, then we can
use RFC 3066 to express the difference, but in many cases this is not true. For
example, both simplified and traditional Chinese are used in Hong Kong S.A.R.;
both Cyrillic and Latin are used in Serbia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan; Indic
languages are customarily written in different scripts, etc.</p>
<p>ISO 15924 contains script codes that could be used, in some cases, to
distinguish future language codes in these cases. Unfortunately, RFC 3066 does
not permit the productive use of script codes for these cases; each example has
to be separately registered, which can take quite a while. <span class="changed2">(There
is good reason for this: ISO 15924 was not ready in time for RFC 3066 to refer
to it!)</span></p>
<p>ISO 15924 does not yet help with simplified Chinese vs. traditional Chinese.
ISO 15924 does allow for <i>variant</i> scripts, such as Latf for the Fraktur
variant of Latin, or Latg for the Gaelic variant. We would need variant codes
for Chinese (Hani) corresponding to simplified and traditional (such as <i>Hans</i>
and <i>Hant</i>) if script codes were used to address the above problem. Thus we
would end up with language codes like <i>zh-Hans</i> or <i>az-Latn</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="changed2"><b>Note: </b>15924 uses a change in the last letter,
  typically, to indicate variants. So <i>Hans</i> and <i>Hant</i> would be more
  likely choices than other possibilities like <i>Hsim</i> and <i>Htra.</i> ISO
  15924 also tends to use titlecase, but in RFC 3066 (and in practice) case
  differences should be ignored. They can, however, be used in running text to
  make the codes more distinctive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows provides codes for languages that are not in RFC 3066 in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemGlobalizationCultureInfoClassTopic.asp">Culture
Info</a>, which is an update to the Windows <i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/getWR/DIS_v2/default.mspx">Developing
International Software, 2nd Edition</a>.</i> That book claims to use RFC 1766
codes (the predecessor of RFC 3066) for the Culture Names (i.e. locale codes).
However, it has codes like <i>az-AZ-Cryl</i> that don't follow the RFC and not
in the current registrations.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b>The above web page corrects the text to say&nbsp; these codes
  are &quot;based on RFC 3066&quot;. It also alters the codes to the form <i>La-uz-UZ</i>
  (for Uzbek using the Latin script), and supplies codes like <i>zh-CHS</i> and <i>zh-CHT</i>
  for simplified and traditional Chinese. However, a <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/icu/dropbox/C-sharp-LocaleNames.html"><i>programmatic
  test</i></a> of the locale codes, using .NET Version 1.0, gives codes in the
  same format as the book.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Best_Format">Best Format</a></h3>
<p class="changed2">We strongly recommend codes of the form <i>uz-Latn-UZ</i> or
<i>zh-Hans-HK</i>, with the script in the middle.</p>
<p class="changed2">The use of the language codes of the form <i>La-uz-UZ</i>
cited above is not optimal. The bare &quot;La&quot; definitely violates RFC
3066; it can't even be registered, since it uses 2 letters, and relies on case
distinctions to separate scripts from countries, which is fragile. The
four-letter form for the script would be consistent with RFC 3066, and would not
be confused in a case-insensitive environment.</p>
<p class="changed2">But even if the two-letter form is changed to four, the form
<i>Latn-uz-UZ</i> is not particularly good. At first glance, it might seem that
script is a &quot;greater&quot; difference than language, and should be at the
top level. But in practice, the differences between languages are greater than
those between scripts. The ordering of script after base language is also better
for resource inheritance chains used in systems like Java or ICU. In those
chains, one strips off trailing subtags to find the resource parent. Any missing
resource, such as string, is inherited from the parent. The resource chain for
some samples is shown in (I).</p>

    <td align="center" width="25%" class="changed2">
      <p class="changed2"><i>Cryl-uz-UZ</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="changed2">But an isolated <i>Cyrl</i> or <i>Latn</i> at the top is
just not very productive. Inheritance with this type of structure doesn't work
in practice, because no common resources would be inherited in common, at the
top level, between <i>Latn-uz-UZ</i> and <i>Latn-az-AZ</i>. Missing strings
would fall back to a completely different language; and in practice an Uzbek is
far less likely to understand information from a different language than that in
a different script.</p>
<p class="changed2">The use of the form <i>uz-UZ-Latn</i> is also not optimal,
as we see when we look at resource inheritance chains. Suppose we have resources
for both Simplified and Traditional Chinese in Hong Kong, Simplified in China
and Traditional in Taiwan:</p>

</table>
<p class="changed2">The key different is at the difference between rows 2 and 3.
In (II) above, these can vary by script; in (III) below these only vary by
region.</p>

  <caption>

</table>
<p class="changed2">The typical differences between regions tend to be rather
small, thus allowing inheritance, whereas the differences between scripts are
huge. So if a string is missing at level 3 in (III), at least it gets the right
script when inheriting from the parent. And typically differences from the
parent are small, allowing most strings to be shared. In case (II), the
resources will have <i>some</i> script in <i>zh-HK</i>: the child with a
different script cannot effectively inherit any strings. And if a string is
missing at level 3, it gets the <i>wrong</i> script when inheriting from the
parent. These differences get even more pronounced when there are many different
countries sharing the same script variant.</p>
<p class="changed">This also fits with the pattern used for <i>yi-latn</i> in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-tags">RFC
3066 -- Language code assignments</a>. Interestingly, there have not yet been
any 3066 assignments of the form &lt;639_code&gt;-&lt;four-letter-code&gt;, so
there would not be any possibility of collisions (if we move quickly).</p>
<p class="changed2">In a sense, on can think of the forms <i>uz-Latn-UZ</i> or <i>zh-Hans-HK</i>,
with the script in the middle, as being &quot;big-endian&quot;; supplying the
most significant information first, and following on with progressive
refinements. This is in line with the current practice in RFC 3066 of language
then region. Not coincidentally, this also works the best with resource
inheritance.</p>
<p class="changed">Matching is the other consideration for the ordering of the
tags. Harald mentions the following goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="changed">matching all Azeri-language docs in Latin, no matter what
    country variant they come from</li>
  <li>
    <p class="changed">matching all Azerbajan-style documents, no matter which
    script they use</li>
</ul>
<p class="changed">The codes <i>az-Latn</i> and <i>az-Cryl</i> are essentially
variants of an ISO 639 language code, and could themselves have country
variants. Thus in practice we would need to register each code combined with
whatever regions made sense, and end up with: <i>az-Latn, az-Latn-AZ, az-Cryl,
az-Cryl-AZ,...</i> in addition to the current <i>az, az-AZ</i>. Thus all of the
matching options would be available.</p>
<h3 class="changed2"><a name="Plan_of_Action">Plan of Action</a></h3>
<p>In any event, the important step is to get the missing written language codes
registered. Ideally, there would simply be ISO 639 codes for the missing written
languages, but failing that, the first steps would be:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Register script variants for Chinese (<i>Hani</i>) corresponding to
    simplified and traditional (such as <i>Hans</i> and <i>Hant</i>) for ISO
    15924.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Register RFC 3066 codes for <span class="changed">the 24 combinations
    needed in the short term</span>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><i>zh-(Hans,Hant), zh-(Hans,Hant)-HK</i></li>
      <li><i>az-(Latn,Cryl), az-(Latn,Cryl)-AZ</i></li>
      <li><i>uz-(Latn,Cryl), uz-(Latn,Cryl)-UZ</i></li>
      <li><i>sr-(Latn,Cryl), sr-(Latn,Cryl)-YU</i>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>On the country code for Serbian, see <a href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/3166.html#serbia">3166
            Question on Serbia</a>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is a minimal list, and does not include all the possible
    combinations of country codes to indicate possible orthographic or spelling
    distinctions, on the pattern of other 3066 codes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>for zh-*: HK, MO, CN, SG, TW, US,...</li>
      <li>for az-*: AZ, IR, ...</li>
      <li>for uz-*: AF, KZ, KG, TJ, TM, UZ, ...</li>
      <li>for sr-*: YU, BA, MK, HR, ...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nor does it encompass all the cases where different scripts are used,
    such as for bibliographic use for transliterations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Start the ball rolling on a 3066bis that would allow the productive use of
    script codes, allowing the formats in addition to the <a href="#Current_RFC_3066_Formats">Current
    RFC 3066 Formats</a>:
    <ol start="5">
      <li>
        <p class="changed"><i>&lt;iso_639_code&gt; &quot;-&quot;
        &lt;iso_15924_code&gt;</i></li>
      <li>
        <p class="changed"><i>&lt;iso_639_code&gt; &quot;-&quot;
        &lt;iso_15924_code&gt; &quot;-&quot; &lt;iso_3166_code&gt;</i></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>It may take some time to do #3, so it is important to do #2 first to meet the
immediate requirements.</p>
<p class="changed"><b>Note:</b> In practice, as Peter Edberg remarks, one ends
up having to have a default for <i>zh</i> found alone (e.g. simplified), when
used in a resource lookup. However, when used as a matching string (see above),
one would not make the assumption. If we didn't care about matching, initially,
we may be able to get by by with just the following 12 combinations in #2. (Or
perhaps fewer, if we limit the Chinese cases to those in actual use in systems,
e.g. HK.)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="changed"><i>zh-Hant, zh-Hant-(HK,MO,CN,SG,TW)</i></li>
  <li>
    <p class="changed"><i>az-Latn, az-Latn-AZ</i></li>
  <li>
    <p class="changed"><i>uz-Latn, uz-Latn-UZ</i></li>
  <li>
    <p class="changed"><i>sr-Latn, sr-Latn-SP</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="changed">We do need Step #3 eventually, for matching purposes, and
since the ways in which languages can be used with different scripts is not
closed. Roozbeh points out, for example, that az-Arab and uz-Arab are both used.
But there was a reason that RFC 3066 allowed productive use of Language + Region
codes: it saves a good detail of time and effort to not have to register all the
combinations that anyone wants. Many different languages can be written in
multiple scripts, and if one counts all the regions that they could be used in,
it would be far better to make this a generative machanism, like it is with ISO
Language + Region codes.</p>
<h2><a name="Resolving_Ambiguities">Resolving Ambiguities</a></h2>
<p>ICU already supports RFC 3066 codes of forms (1)-(3) in <a href="#Current_RFC_3066_Formats">Current
RFC 3066 Formats</a>; the types of codes not yet supported are of the form:</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li><i>&lt;iso_639_code&gt; &quot;-&quot; &lt;iso_3166_code&gt;</i>.</li>
</ol>
<p>One reason for the hesitation in supporting (4) was that there is not a clean
line between language codes and locale codes, nor a clean line between the sorts
of data is associated with either one. (See <a href="#Language_vs_Locale_Codes">Language
vs. Locale Codes</a>.) Here is our recommendation for supporting (4) by
disambiguating problematic cases. Take the following two examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>zh-TW-HK,</i> could be either:
    <ol>
      <li type="a">lang = <i>zh-TW</i>, region = <i>HK</i>, no variant, or</li>
      <li type="a">lang = <i>zh</i>, region = <i>TW</i>, variant = <i>HK</i></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><i>zh-TW,</i> could be either:
    <ol>
      <li type="a">lang = <i>zh-TW</i>, no region, or</li>
      <li type="a">lang = <i>zh</i>, region = <i>TW</i></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>To match the mostly likely usage, we propose interpreting these as (1a) and
(2b). That is, if we have <i>x-y-z-...</i> (where trailing fields might be
missing), we check <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> to see which are valid 2 or 3 letter
region codes. If <i>y</i> and <i>z </i>are both valid region codes, we use (1a),
otherwise we use (1b).</p>
<p>As far as resource data goes, we would use the following typical hierarchy
for such complex cases. The inheritance goes from the bottom up.</p>

<p>When resolving locale names, we would map <i>x-y-y</i> to <i>x-y</i>, so <i>zh-TW-TW</i>
would map to <i>zh-TW</i>. We can also alias a whole resource bundle (such as
for <i>zh-CN-HK</i>) to another resource bundle (such as <i>zh-HK</i>). It would
be good, however, to have a canonical mapping to shortest language names, so
that such explicit aliasing would not be necessary, and the locales could be
transformed to a canonical form before lookup. This would also be needed in
dealing with cases like vs <i>az-AZ, az-Latn-AZ</i>, and <i>az-Cryl-AZ</i> ,
also for cases where either the two letter or three letter ISO 639 or 3166 codes
are supplied.</p>
<p>Of course, the situation would be far easier if there were separate ISO 639
codes or RFC 3066 codes for simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese, as
discussed above. We would then have <i>zh-Hant-HK</i> instead of <i>zh-TW-HK</i>,
etc., with fewer ambiguities. <span class="changed">We would still need to have
some kind of lookup to get a unique form (<i>zh-Hant-TW</i> =&gt; <i>zh-TW</i>),
as discussed by Peter Edberg, but that would not be particularly onerous.</span></p>
<p>In ICU, we have two variant codes with two letters: <i>AL</i> and <i>NY</i>.
In both cases, we make longer names for these aliases, and will grandfather in
locale data that has these two codes. (<i>NY</i> is not an issue; it is present
for backwards compatibility, and does not match an existing region. <i>AL</i> is
used in <i>sv_FI_AL</i>; but it is extremely unlikely that anyone would need
&quot;Swedish as spoken in Finland, used in Albania&quot;, so there is little
loss in special casing this one.)</p>
<h3><a name="Language_vs_Locale_Codes">Language vs. Locale Codes</a></h3>
<p class="changed">Part of the fuzziness around this whole topic is that people
have very slippery notions of what distinguishes a language code vs. a locale
code. The problem is that both are somewhat nebulous concepts.</p>
<p class="changed"><i>In practice, </i>many people use RFC 3066 codes to mean
locale codes instead of strictly language codes. It is easy to see why this came
about; because RFC 3066 includes an explicit region (country) code, for most
people it was sufficient for use as a locale code as well. For example, when
typical web software receives an RFC 3066 code, it use it as a locale code.
Other typical software will do the same: in practice, language codes and locale
codes are treated interchangeably. Some people recommend distinguishing on the
basis of &quot;-&quot; vs &quot;_&quot; (e.g. <i>zh-TW</i> for language code, <i>zh_TW</i>
for locale code), but in practice that does not work because of the free
variation out in the world in the use of these separators. Notice that Windows,
for example, uses &quot;-&quot; as a separator in its locale codes. So
pragmatically we are forced to treat &quot;-&quot; and &quot;_&quot; as
equivalent.</p>
<p class="changed">Another reason for the conflation of these codes is that very
little data in most systems is distinguished by region alone; currency codes and
measurement systems being some of the few. Sometimes date or number formats are
mentioned as regional, but that really doesn't make much sense. If I saw the
sentence &quot;You will have to adjust the value to &#2407;,&#2408;&#2409;&#2410;.&#2411;&#2412;&#2413;
from &#2797;&#2791;,&#2792;&#2793;&#2794;.&#2795;&#2796;&quot; (using Indic
digits), I would say that sentence is simply not English. Number format is far
more closely associated with language than it is with region. The same is true
for date formats: I would never expect to see intermixed a date in the format
&quot;2003&#24180;4&#26376;1&#26085;&quot; (using Kanji) in text purporting to
be purely English. There are regional differences in date and number format —
differences which can be important — but those are different in kind than
other language differences between regions.</p>
<p>Notice also that currency <i>codes</i> are different than currency <i>localizations</i>.
The currency localizations are typically in the language-based resource bundles,
not in the region-based resource bundles. Thus, the resource bundle <i>en_US</i>
will contain the currency code USD; the resource bundle <i>en</i> will contain
no currency code, but will contain the localized mappings in English for a range
of different currency codes: USD =&gt; $, RUR =&gt; Rub, etc. (In protocols, the
currency codes should always accompany any currency amounts; otherwise the data
is ambiguous, and software is forced to use the user's locale to guess at the
currency. But that is subject for a different document, <span class="changed"><a href="jit_localization.html">JIT
Localization</a><span>.)</span></span></p>
