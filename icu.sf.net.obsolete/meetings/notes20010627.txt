Minutes taker: Markus Scherer

Agenda items:
- NUL termination of output strings in the C API
  + Markus: want to repropose to keep current behavior of C wrappers,
    make all other APIs consistent with this
  + always attempt to append a NUL
  + no error code if only NUL does not fit
  + user needs to allocate length+1 if they need the NUL
  + may need to check length<capacity to make sure that it fit if NUL is necessary
  + one reason to change original proposal:
    many APIs involved do not have srcLength, so consistent behavior
    cannot depend on that

- versioning of collators
  + Mark: there is a problem with versioning:
    versioning tailoring may result in wrong version if fallback chain changed
    from last collator use
  + new proposal: get a BLOB from a collator that stores its entire state
    and allows to later instantiate a collator with the very same behavior
  + Tex: this is an issue for database indexing
    given the described problem, we will want to use this BLOB
  + Tex: databases are rarely re-indexed because it is an expensive operation
  + Andy: How far back do we need to keep old versions of collation data?
    Tex/Helena: users need some 5 to 10 years of support
    may or may not want to update a collation implementation during that time
  + It will be possible to get information about a BLOB by instantiating
    a collator from it and getting its attributes
- Discussion of sort key length
  + worst case may be some 10x of average for a given string length
  + Tex: databases may need maximum or may have variable-length keys
  + Mark: at least when you truncate sort keys
    you truncate information that is less important
  + Tex: better to provide APIs to work with sort keys than to document
    their structure
