2. CLDR Identifiers for new timezone data
    Mark: We should propose to CLDR committee to publish a dot dot release with changes for timezone,i.e, only changes to supplemental data allowed.
    Vladimir: Decouple data releases from spec releases
    Ram: dot dot releases should not be restricted to supplemental data. There are reasons for having new data in dot dot releases,e.g., Serbia & Montenegro dis-unification.
    Decided to continue this conversation in CLDR meeting

3. Review of Big Red Switch document for ICU release
    Markus: Add a column for due date
    Markus: is this list the latest
    Andy: combined BRS from WiKi and html file to create a master list
4. Function export control on Mac OS X (or gcc in general, take your pick)
    Deborah: Change U_EXPORT macro for MacOSX. GCC 4.0 for MaxOSX contains options to prevent symbols from being exported. ICU should take advantage of this option on OSX. By default GCC 4.0 even with new definition of U_EXPORT will export all symbols. Compiler options need to be set correctly to take advantage of this feature.
    Markus: ICU already does this on Windows. Good idea to do the same on other platforms
    Steven: turn on this swich for GCC 4.0 regardless of option
    Deborah: not available on all platforms.
    Decided tof fix this in3.6

5. Jitterbug 5186 oddities
    Deborah: assignment operator in DecimalFormat does not set all fields. Needs to be looked at by DecimalFormat experts
    Mark & Steven to look at the code

6. log10 issue
    Steven: 
        + uprv_log10() method is not used by any library function
        + only used by tests
        + Fails on MacOSX
    Deborah: method makes unwarranted assumptions
    Decided to remove the method from ICU library and make the tests call std library function.
