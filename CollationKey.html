Collation keys are generated by the Collator class.  Use the CollationKey objects
instead of Collator to compare strings multiple times.  A CollationKey
preprocesses the comparison information from the Collator object to
make the comparison faster.  If you are not going to comparing strings
multiple times, then using the Collator object is generally faster,
since it only processes as much of the string as needed to make a
comparison.
<p> For example (with strength == tertiary)
<p>When comparing "Abernathy" to "Baggins-Smythworthy", Collator
only needs to process a couple of characters, while a comparison
with CollationKeys will process all of the characters.  On the other hand,
if you are doing a sort of a number of fields, it is much faster to use
CollationKeys, since you will be comparing strings multiple times.
<p>Typical use of CollationKeys are in databases, where you store a CollationKey
in a hidden field, and use it for sorting or indexing.

<p>Example of use:
<pre>
.    UErrorCode success = ZERO_ERROR;
.    Collator* myCollator = Collator::createInstance(success);
.    CollationKey* keys = new CollationKey [3];
.    myCollator->getCollationKey("Tom", keys[0], success );
.    myCollator->getCollationKey("Dick", keys[1], success );
.    myCollator->getCollationKey("Harry", keys[2], success );
. 
.    // Inside body of sort routine, compare keys this way:
.    CollationKey tmp;
.    if(keys[0].compareTo( keys[1] ) > 0 ) {
.        tmp = keys[0]; keys[0] = keys[1]; keys[1] = tmp;
.    }
.    //...
</pre>
<p>Because Collator::compare()'s algorithm is complex, it is faster to sort
long lists of words by retrieving collation keys with Collator::getCollationKey().
You can then cache the collation keys and compare them using CollationKey::compareTo().
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> <code>Collator</code>s with different Locale,
CollationStrength and DecompositionMode settings will return different
CollationKeys for the same set of strings. Locales have specific 
collation rules, and the way in which secondary and tertiary differences 
are taken into account, for example, will result in different CollationKeys
for same strings.
