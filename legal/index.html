<h2><a name="Crediting_ICU">ICU and Your Product's License List</a></h2>
<h3>Licenses</h3>
<p>Include in your list of licenses the current
versions of both of the following licenses (follow the links to get the current
versions), regardless
of whether your product ships with ICU only in binary form - shared libraries
(.dll, .so, .sl, etc.) and/or compiled data (.dat, .cnv, .res, etc.) -
and/or with ICU source files and/or ICU documentation.</p>
<p>For the code entitled [ICU4C and/or ICU4J and/or ICU4JNI]:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/license.html"> ICU license</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/unidata/ucdterms.txt">Unicode
license</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Providing ICU source files</h3>
<p>If you ship ICU source code (.c, .cpp, .java, .h, etc.), plain-text source data files (.txt, .ucm, ...), and/or ICU documentation (.html, .pdf, ...), whether
    modified or not, then you also need to leave the copyright notices in each
source file.</p>
<p>(Historical note: For binary-only
shipments, the inclusion of the ICU license is necessary with the X license
style used since ICU4C 1.8.1/ICU4J 1.3.1. It was not
required with ICU4C 1.8.0/ICU4J 1.3.0 and earlier <a href="#Old_ICU">which used the IBM Public
License</a>. ICU4C and ICU4J changed at the same time: At that time, ICU4C and
ICU4J version numbers were not yet synchronized.)</p>
<h2><a name="X_License">X License</a> and Copyrights</h2>
<p>The ICU projects use the X license, with the exact text at <a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/license.html">ICU4C License</a>
and <a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu4j/trunk/license.html">ICU4J License</a>.
The X license [which used to be available at
http://www.x.org/Downloads_terms.html but seems to be moving around] is a simple open-source license that is still compatible with GPL without
forcing ICU to be GPL or your project to be open-source. All code contributed to the projects must be covered by this license, which includes an IP license allowing anyone to use
the code without charge.</p>
<p>The ICU project contains code with non-IBM copyrights.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For anything material, IBM asks for a Copyright Assignment letter [<a href="contributions/Copyright_Assignment.rtf">RTF</a>].</li>
  <li>For code and patches submitted via the bug database, the <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs">Jitterbug</a>
    submission page includes an agreement to the right to use the submission.</li>
  <li>For more information on contributions to ICU, see <a href="contributions/code_contributions.html">Code Contributions</a>.</li>
  <li>For information on non-IBM copyright statements, see <a href="copyright.html">Copyrights</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Others">Other</a> Open-source Projects</h2>
  <p>You can use ICU code in other Open Source projects.
  While ICU is <i><b>not</b></i> under the GNU license, the X license that
  ICU uses is listed under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">GPL-Compatible,
  Free Software Licenses</a> (under the X11 heading).</p>

<h2><a name="Old_ICU">Old</a> Versions of ICU</h2>
<p>ICU (ICU4C) before release 1.8.1 and ICU4J before release 1.3.1 (before June of 2001) are covered by the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-ipl.html">IBM
Public License</a>, an open-source license developed by IBM attorneys and approved by leaders of the open-source community. All code contributed to the projects was covered by this
license.</p>
