<h1>Character Conversion Alias Design</h1>
<h3>Draft 2001-07-12</h3>
<p>Character Conversion is complicated by the facts that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>different vendors may have different names for the same mapping.</li>
  <li>different vendors may have the same name for different mappings</li>
</ul>
<p>ICU attempts to untangle this morass in the following ways.</p>
<p>1. There will be unique name for each mapping table on all ICU supported
platforms (390, 400, AIX, Solaris, Windows, HP/UX) plus on Java and the Mac, in
the format given by <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/">UTR
#22: Character Mapping Tables</a>.</p>
<p>2. There will be APIs that supply information relating platform names
(aliases) for character mappings to this canonical name.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b>by an <i>alias,</i> we mean any name that is commonly used to
  refer to that character conversion mapping on that platform. For example, if I
  am working on AIX with HTTP, what CCSID do I use when I encounter
  charset=&quot;SJIS&quot;? Similarly, what is the (preferred) alias that I
  would use when generating HTML or XML that is supposed to be in a particular
  CCSID? The tables that relate aliases to CCSIDs may be in the operating
  system, or they may be in major products like DB2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sketch of the APIs are presented below (in pseudocode, since we don't want
to worry about the exact signatures yet):</p>
<h3>Basic</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the canonical name, given the platform and alias. If the platform
  is null, then a default is returned.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>String ucnv_getCanonicalName(String alias, String platform);</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Returns an alias, given the canonical name and a platform. If the platform
  is null, then a default is returned.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>String ucnv_getPreferredAlias(String canonicalName, String platform);</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To guarantee interoperability, the default values are chosen to be same
  across all platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Listing</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the platforms for which ICU has mapping tables:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>String[] ucnv_getPlatforms();</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Returns a list of all the aliases that map to the given canonical name on
  the given platform. The first name is the preferred one.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>String[] ucnv_getAliases(String canonicalName, String platform);</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Note: for both basic and listing, the platform value might be an enum
instead of a string.</i></p>
<h3>Data Structure</h3>
<p>Logically, all of this could be supported by the following three mappings</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td>Main</td>
    <td>alias, platform =&gt; canonicalName</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DefaultForCanonicalName</td>
    <td>canonicalName =&gt; alias</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DefaultForAlias</td>
    <td>alias =&gt; canonicalName</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>However, we can simplify the mapping considerably, by accepting a superset of
names that are actually used on each platform. That way, we don't have to mark
the names with the precise set of platforms that they are used on; only where it
is important, such as where we need different aliases for different platforms.</p>
<p>Thoughts on how we could pack this, and still look up items quickly. This is
a first pass -- we might come up with something cleverer or more compact after
thinking about it.</p>
<p>Put the aliases into a sorted list. The index in that list now stands for the
alias. Do the same for canonical names and platforms. So now all the mappings
are in terms of integers. The aliases and canonical names fit in 2 bytes; the
platforms in 1 byte. Actually, we only use 7 bits; the top bit is a termination
flag. A platform of 0x7F stands for &quot;Any&quot;</p>
<p>The main table is a list of 2-byte offsets, one for each alias. Each offset
points to a list of three-byte units. In each unit, the first two bytes are the
canonical name, and the last byte is the platform. The last unit is indicated by
an 0x80 bit&nbsp; in the platform byte. The first unit is the default canonical
name for that alias, and is also the default in case there is no match for the
platform. There is at most one unit for each platform in the list.</p>
<p>The reverse table is similar, except that it starts with a list of 2-byte
offsets, one for each canonical name. Each offset points to a list of three-byte
units. In each unit, the first two bytes are the alias.&nbsp; The last unit is
indicated by an 0x80 bit&nbsp; in the platform byte. The first unit is the
default alias for that canonical, and is also the default in case there is no
match for the platform. There may be more than one unit for each platform in the
list. The first unit with a matching platform is the default alias for that
platform.</p>
<h3>Resource Bundle Format</h3>
<p>The current format is the following:</p>
<p><a
href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/cvs/icu/data/convrtrs.txt?rev=1.81">http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/cvs/icu/data/convrtrs.txt?rev=1.81</a></p>
<p>This format is almost sufficient to get what we need; it basically
corresponds to the reverse table above. We would need the following changes.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Change the &quot;Actual file name&quot; to be the canonical name. Where we
    need to, add the old one as an alias.</li>
  <li>Add a tag for each platform.</li>
  <li>The default alias (for the given canonical name) can be work as above.</li>
  <li>We add one piece of syntax for marking the default canonical name for a
    given alias. I suggest the following: Given an alias name A
    <ol type="a">
      <li>If there is a * following A on a line, then the canonical name for
        that line is the default for A.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if there is a * following a canonical name, and that line
        contains A, then that canonical name is the default for A.</li>
      <li>The builder code throws an error:
        <ul>
          <li>If there are no lines satisfying either (a) or (b) for A.</li>
          <li>If there are two different lines satisfying (a) for A.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The builder code throws an error two different canonical names have the
    same &lt;alias, platform&gt;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<h4>old</h4>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td>CName</td>
    <td>Aliases</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ibm-916</td>
    <td>iso-8859-8 { MIME } hebrew cp916 8859-8 csisolatinhebrew iso-ir-138
      ISO_8859-8:1988 { IANA } 916</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h4>new</h4>
<table border="1" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td>CName</td>
    <td>Aliases</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>iso-8859_8-1988*</td>
    <td>iso-8859-8 { MIME } hebrew cp916 8859-8 csisolatinhebrew iso-ir-138
      ISO_8859-8:1988 { IANA } 916 ibm-916</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The reverse table is easy to build from this. As it is being built, the
mappings for the main table can be collected and then organized and written out.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>BTW, we should move the converter data files to a subfolder of /data/ so
  they are not interleaved with other files. Also, I think readability would be
  improved if we allowed commas in the lists, e.g.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iso-8859-8 { MIME } hebrew cp916 8859-8 csisolatinhebrew iso-ir-138
      ISO_8859-8:1988 { IANA } 916 ibm-916</li>
    <li>iso-8859-8 { MIME }, hebrew, cp916, 8859-8, csisolatinhebrew,
      iso-ir-138, ISO_8859-8:1988 { IANA }, 916, ibm-916</li>
  </ul>
