                            All C++ classes must inherit the common base class UObject or UMemory

                                But not for mixin/interface classes (pure virtual, no data members, no 
                                constructors) because that would break the single-inheritance model.<li>
                                Also not for pure-static classes (used for name scoping) — declare but don't 
                                implement a private default constructor to prevent instantiation.<li>
                                    Simple struct-like C++ classes (and structs) that do not have constructors, 
                                    destructors, and virtual methods, need not inherit the base class but must then 
                                    be allocated with uprv_malloc.
                                </li>

                            For Testing that this is the case, on Linux
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    run the Perl script ICUMemCheck.pl. Follow the instructions in the script. The 
                                    script is in in the ICU4C sources at icu/tools/memcheck/ICUMemCheck.pl.

                            </ul>
                        <li>
                            For testing that this is the case, on Windows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Don't bother, as of Nov, 2004. Failures appear in many dozens of files from the 
                                    mixin class destructors. Do the check on Linux. But, for reference, here are 
                                    the old instructions.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Make sure that in uobject.h UObject::new and delete are defined by default. 
                                            Currently, this means to grep to see that <tt>U_OVERRIDE_CXX_ALLOCATION</tt>
                                        is defined to 1 (in pwin32.h for Windows).<li>
                                        Check the *.obj's for linkage to the global (non-UObject::) operators 
                                        new/delete; see uobject.cpp for details.<li>
                                        Global new must never be imported. Global delete will be imported and used by 
                                        empty-virtual destructors in interface/mixin classes. However, they are not 
                                        called because implementation classes always derive from UMemory. No other 
                                        functions must use global delete.<li>
                                            There are now (2002-dec-17) definitions in <tt>utypes.h</tt>
                                        for global new/delete, with inline implementations that will always crash. 
                                        These global new/delete operators are only defined for code inside the ICU4C 
                                        libraries (but must be there for all of those). See Jitterbug 2581.<li>
                                            If a global new/delete is used somewhere, then change the class inheritance 
                                            and/or use uprv_malloc/free until no global new/delete are used in the 
                                            libraries (and the tests still pass...). See the User Guide Coding Guidelines 
                                            for details.&nbsp;</li></ul>

                    What is a "daily build" process?<br>
                    You need to submit an ICU build request on the internal IBM build server. Enter 
                    the "tag" you have just created for the snapshot to be tested with. Submit the 
                    build to be tested on <b>ALL</b> the reference platforms. The daily build 
                    process needs to start at least a week and half before the final release date. 
                    (Post a message to the mailing list to inform people of the daily build 
                    starting date). The default build options are fine, but these other 
                    configurations also need testing. See also <a href="http://icu.sanjose.ibm.com/internal/wiki?IcuBuilds">
                        IcuBuilds</a> on the wiki.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Build both the debug and release configurations.<li>
                        Build DLL, memory mappable and individual files format of the data files.<li>
                        Make sure the tests are run with exhaustive mode turned on. This test takes a 
                        while and should be done overnight.<li>
                            Make sure that the libraries can be installed by requesting that the binaries 
                            are built. These files are also needed by ICU4JNI.</li>
