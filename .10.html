<tt>u_normalize</tt> transforms Unicode text into an equivalent composed or
decomposed form, allowing for easier sorting and searching of text.
<tt>u_normalize</tt> supports the standard normalization forms described in
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/" target="unicode">
Unicode Technical Report #15</a>.
<p>
Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded in
several different ways in Unicode.  For example, take the character "Á"
(A-acute).   In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single character (the
"composed" form):
<pre>
00C1    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE</pre>
or as two separate characters (the "decomposed" form):
<pre>
0041    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
0301    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</pre>
<p>
To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences should be
treated as the same "user-level" character "Á".  When you are searching or
comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are treated 
equivalently.  In addition, you must handle characters with more than one
accent.  Sometimes the order of a character's combining accents is
significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different orders are
really equivalent.
<p>
Similarly, the string "ffi" can be encoded as three separate letters:
<pre>
0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
0069    LATIN SMALL LETTER I</pre>
or as the single character
<pre>
FB03    LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI</pre>
<p>
The ffi ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and strictly speaking
it shouldn't be in Unicode at all, but it was included for compatibility
with existing character sets that already provided it.  The Unicode standard
identifies such characters by giving them "compatibility" decompositions
into the corresponding semantic characters.  When sorting and searching, you
will often want to use these mappings.
<p>
<tt>u_normalize</tt> helps solve these problems by transforming text into the
canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first example above.  
In addition, you can have it perform compatibility decompositions so that 
you can treat compatibility characters the same as their equivalents.
Finally, <tt>u_normalize</tt> rearranges accents into the proper canonical
order, so that you do not have to worry about accent rearrangement on your
own.
<p>
<tt>u_normalize</tt> adds one optional behavior, {@link #UCOL_IGNORE_HANGUL},
that differs from
the standard Unicode Normalization Forms.
