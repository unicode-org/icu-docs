<h1>UCA Latin Recommendations</h1>
<p>Mark Davis, 2004-07-26 (modified 2004-10-08)</p>
<p><b>The document contains proposals for changes in UCA for the weightings of a small number of 
Latin characters (out 1870 entries in the UCA for Latin). This proposal is controversial, so we 
would like feedback, both pro and con, on the proposed change.</b></p>
<p>It is important that we ensure that the UCA weightings are as good as possible. Collation has 
application not merely in presenting lists of sorted strings to users, but also in database queries, 
and in language-sensitive matching. It is crucial, for example, that user expectations are met for 
how ordering concerns. Consider the example of a German businessman making a database selection, 
such as to sum up revenue in each of of the cities from <i>O...</i> to <i>P...</i> for planning 
purposes. If behind his back all cities starting with <i>Ö</i> are excluded because the query 
selection is using a Swedish collation, there is going to be one very unhappy customer. Similarly, 
sorting &quot;Søren&quot; after &quot;Sozar&quot; in a long list — if that is not expected in the user's language — will 
cause problems. A user will look for &quot;Søren&quot;between &quot;Sorem&quot; and &quot;Soret&quot;, <i>not</i> see it on the 
page, and assume it isn't there; fooled by the fact that it is on a completely different page. In 
matching, the same can occur, which can have cause significant problems for software customers; and 
as with database selection, the user may not realize what he is missing.</p>
<p>With Unicode being deployed so widely, this is even more important; multilingual data becomes the 
rule, not the exception. A French company with customers all over Europe is going to have names from 
many different languages — French, German, Polish, Swedish, etc. If a German employee sets the 
sorting (or matching/selecting) language to be German, then the names need to show up in the order 
appropriate for German, even though there will be many different accented characters that do not 
normally appear in German text.</p>
<p>Stability is important, and we want to consider changes carefully. However, we know that if the 
UCA is changed in any way, then any tailoring is affected in that it will produce a different 
ordering for some characters (any that it does not explicitly override). So any implementation's 
versioning scheme must take account of this. This will always be the case, unless we completely 
freeze the UCA, disallowing fixes for, say, Indic characters. But the UTC clearly has not agreed to 
do freeze UCA; while stability is very important, we have left ourselves the ability to make changes 
in the UCA when warranted. </p>
<p>And the only tailorings that would be affected for the worse are ones where the tailoring depends 
on inheriting the order from the UCA for the affected characters. In a great many of these cases, 
the UCA order must be tailored anyway for any of these characters that are needed in the languages. 
For example, Ø must be tailored for Danish (<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/common/collation/da.xml">da.xml</a>). 
Note that in CLDR, we explicitly do not depend on the UCA ordering for the following characters when 
they are considered separate letters in the language; for example, in Polish you will see explicit 
weighting of &#321; (<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/common/collation/pl.xml">pl.xml</a>).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Changing Æ to be an expansion</h2>
<p>The character Æ (and its lowercase) should sort with a primary weight of AE, just like Œ sorts 
with a primary weight of OE currently.</p>
<table>
  <tr class="in">
    <td>
    <img style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="00C6" src="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/refglyph?24-00C6"></td>
    <td>Æ</td>
    <td>00C6</td>
    <td>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <img style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="01FC" src="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/refglyph?24-01FC"></td>
    <td>&#508;</td>
    <td>01FC</td>
    <td>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE WITH ACUTE</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <img style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="01E2" src="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/refglyph?24-01E2"></td>
    <td>&#482;</td>
    <td>01E2</td>
    <td>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE WITH MACRON</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Traditionally, except for a very few languages, Æ is considered to be a presentation variant of 
AE. You see that in variation in representation between words like hæmophilia and haemophilia, 
cæsium and caesium. In some languages (or variants, like American English*), the spelling has been 
reformed to convert to 'e' or another letter. But where the vast majority of people see Æ, they will 
consider it to behave like AE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In English, the OED and Webster's Revised both show this Æ behaving as AE:
  <span style="color:black">...Cady, Cæca, Cæcal, Cæcias, Cæcilian, Cæcum, Cænozoic, Caen stone, 
  Cæsar, Cæsarean, Cæsarism, Cæsious, Cæsium, Cæspitose, Cæsura, Cæsural, Café...</span></li>
  <li>In French, this is also the case: we have &quot;<i>Les digrammes soudés (ligatures) comme « æ » et 
  « œ » sont classés avec les lettres doubles correspondantes, en les discriminant toutefois par un 
  indice de priorité particulier, pour assurer la prévisibilité absolue du classement.... cadurcien, 
  cæcum, caennais, cæsium, cafard</i>&quot; — RÈGLES DU CLASSEMENT ALPHABÉTIQUE EN LANGUE FRANÇAISE ET 
  PROCÉDURE INFORMATISÉE POUR LE TRI, as well as major dictionaries.</li>
  <li>For German, DIN 5007 requires this behavior: Æ as a secondary difference from AE.</li>
  <li>The European ordering rules (<a href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/CEN/TC304/EOR/eor4r.pdf">http://anubis.dkuug.dk/CEN/TC304/EOR/eor4r.pdf</a>) 
  require this.</li>
  <li>The Scandinavian languages are unaffected by this change, since they have to will tailor Æ to 
  be a letter above z right now anyway.. All other languages would tailor it to be a secondary (or 
  tertiary) difference from ae, to reflect alternate spellings like Cæsar or hæmoglobin.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>* Note: </i>of course, there may be more dramatic respellings than the American one, such as: 
caeisiam, cæsium, cäsiumn,cesi, cesio, césio, cesiom, cesiun, cesium, cesium, césiumm, cesiumn, 
cesiwm, cesyum, céz, cezm, cezi', cezij, c&#275;zijs, cezio, cezis, cezium, cézium, kaishum, sesín, 
sesium, seziom, sezyum, si&#380;jum, tseesium, tseziumu, xezi,xêzi, zäsium, zäsiumn, zesioa.</p>
<h2>2. Changing characters with diacritics to secondary difference</h2>
<p>The following characters (and their lowercases) should be made secondary differences from their 
bases in UCA 4.1 rather than primary differences.</p>

</table>
<p>Users don't distinguish between types of accents. They do not understand why the default ordering 
of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH OGONEK makes it sort with I, while the default ordering of LATIN 
CAPITAL LETTER Z WITH HOOK makes it sort as a completely separate letter than Z.</p>
<table>
  <tr class="ok">
    <td>
    <img style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="012E" src="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/refglyph?24-012E"></td>
    <td>&#302;</td>
    <td>012E</td>
    <td>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH OGONEK</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <img style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="0224" src="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/refglyph?24-0224"></td>
    <td>&#548;</td>
    <td>0224</td>
    <td>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z WITH HOOK</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Even where a language distinguishes certain accented letters as separate letters for 
collation/matching, they expect letters to be treated uniformly. In Polish letters with diacritics &#260; 
&#262; &#280; &#321; &#323; Ó &#346; &#377; &#379; are sorted after the corresponding letters without. Querying Polish users, they will 
expect them either to be all separate letters, or for them all to be sorted with their base: they 
see no reason for singling out &#321; for different treatment than the others.</p>
<p>And if a German customer is accessing a database full of European names, and expects to find &#280; 
with E, and &#260; with A and &#379; with Z and &#321; with L, then he will be right <i>except</i> for the last one 
with the current UCA. If s/he expects that a database SELECT of all client names starting with &quot;L&quot; 
will include the &quot;&#321;&quot; names also, then s/he will get&nbsp; the wrong answer in a financial report — 
probably not realizing it is wrong. If s/he looks for a client name S&#322;ownik* within a page of Sl... 
and doesn't think to look 3 pages down after Sz, then s/he will get the wrong answer — probably not 
realizing it is wrong. If s/he searches for a name within a body of text using a weak 
language-sensitive match, and doesn't find it, then s/he will get the wrong answer — probably not 
realizing it is wrong.</p>
<p>Again we see the same pattern of behavior:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In German DIN 5007, it indeed says that letters with diacritics are sorted with the same 
  primary weight (Section 5.1.1.3) and explicitly lists in 6.2.3.1.1 &quot;overstrikes&quot; as being 
  diacritics, and gives &#321; as an example of that.</li>
  <li>The European ordering rules (<a href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/CEN/TC304/EOR/eor4r.pdf">http://anubis.dkuug.dk/CEN/TC304/EOR/eor4r.pdf</a>)
  </li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Q&amp; A</h2>
<p><b>Q. </b>Doesn't this propose to reverse the <i>explicit </i>design principles that went into 
the default tailorable template in the <i>first</i> place. Similar letters are near — but not 
interfiled with — similar letters. This is <b>more</b> than enough to give any casual user the 
functionality he needs, because only in initial position is there likely to be any confusion in 
real-life sorted word lists.</p>
<p><b>A. </b>What we actually did was to put similar letters near other letters, <i>and</i> if their 
decompositions were the<br>
same we interfiled them. To users, however, there is little difference between Å, &#321; , &#315; , Ñ, Ø, &#416;, 
and Ô that would cause a user to think that the some should be interfiled and some should not. Å is 
seen as a separate letter in the languages that use it, but UCA &quot;interfiles&quot; it. &#321; is also seen as a 
separate letter, and UCA doesn't. In some languages these would be seen as &quot;separate letters&quot; (e.g. 
with different primary weights) and in others not; but that does not line up in any particular way 
with what is in the UCA.</p>
<p>And making it a primary vs secondary difference can have some important consequences; not all 
sorted elements are very small lists, with all affected characters within a few lines of each other 
on a single page, where placement doesn't matter too much. This doesn't work with large lists, 
database selection, matching (where I won't see that I am missing something), etc.</p>
<p><b>Q. </b>O-slash<i> is </i>treated as a separate letter in the pronunciation guides of all 
IPA-based dictionaries, which constitute the majority of the world's usage, currently. So shouldn't 
it be left as a &quot;separate letter&quot;?</p>
<font SIZE="3"></font>
<p><b>A. </b>First, we don't know that UCA out of the box sorts IPA correctly — nor do we have much 
of an idea what constitutes the &quot;correct&quot; IPA sorting. The IPA specification itself does not appear 
to have any sorting requirement. Secondly, even in dictionaries, the entries are not normally sorted 
by the IPA, they are sorted by the words that the IPA is glossing. Thirdly — <i>and much more 
importantly</i> — the amount of sorted IPA data is going to be dwarfed by the amount of data sorted 
according to normal language conventions.</p>
<p>The fact that IPA uses these letters as being <i>different</i> is completely aside from the 
point. Everyone agrees that for that purpose they are different characters: Å and A are different 
characters, but interleaved in UCA; &#321; and L are different characters, but not interleaved in UCA.<br>
<br>
<b>Q. </b>Won't this produce a visually disturbing effect, as in the following?</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th width="50%">Interleaved (Recommendation)</th>
    <th width="50%">Separate (Current UCA)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td width="50%">ofofofo<br>
    oføfofo<br>
    øfofofo<br>

    ofofofp<br>
    oføfofo<br>
    øfofofo<br>
    øfoføfø</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This is an curious perception, since this is only one case out of 102 accented o's, where all the 
others are interleaved. And of course visual disturbance of multiple characters in such artificial 
examples with multiple marks has little to do with sorting/matching behavior.</p>
