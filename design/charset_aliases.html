    <h1>Character Conversion Alias Design</h1>

    <p>Draft 2002-09-10<br>
     <!--Author: George Rhoten--></p>

    <h2>Background Information</h2>

    <p>Character Conversion is complicated by the facts that:</p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Different vendors may have different names for the same mapping.</li>

      <li>Different vendors may have the same name for different mappings</li>

      <li>Different vendors may radically change the mappings without changing
      the name.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>ICU will attempt to untangle this problem in the following ways.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>There will be unique canonical names for each mapping table on all
      ICU supported platforms (z/OS, iSeries, AIX, Solaris, Windows, HP/UX)
      plus on Java and the Mac, in the format given by <a href=
      "http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/">UTR #22: Character Mapping
      Tables</a>.</li>

      <li>There will be APIs that supply information relating platform names
      (aliases) for character mappings to this canonical name.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Definition of terms</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Alias</dt>

      <dd>Any name that is commonly used to refer to that character conversion
      mapping on that platform. For example, if I am working on AIX with HTTP,
      what CCSID do I use when I encounter charset="SJIS"? Similarly, what is
      the preferred alias that I would use when generating HTML or XML that is
      supposed to be in a particular CCSID? The tables that relate aliases to
      CCSIDs may be in the operating system, or they may be in major products
      like DB2.</dd>

      <dt>Canonical Name</dt>

      <dd>A standardized way to specify an alias for a Unicode codepage mapping
      as specified by UTR #22. Different canonical aliases can have the same
      Unicode mapping, but any given canonical alias can only have one Unicode
      character set mapping</dd>

      <dt>Standard or Platform</dt>

      <dd>A registration authority (e.g. IANA, MIME, ISO), a specific type of
      application (e.g. DB/2), or a specific flavor of an operating system
      (e.g. Windows, AIX, z/OS (a.k.a os/390))</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>These are the goals of this design document.</p>

    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Provide a more "accurate" way to get a specific converter based on a
      platform.</li>

      <li>Provide a way to get a reasonable fallback converter when a requested
      converter doesn't exist in ICU.</li>

      <li>Provide a way to allow legacy platforms to recognize a given
      alias.</li>

      <li>Keep the new design simple enough so that users don't have to know
      about the complications with proper aliasing and versioning.</li>

      <li>Make the new design flexible enough so that "power users" can get the
      right version and platform specific codepage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>

    <p>These are the assumptions for this design.</p>

    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Different vendors may have different names for the same mapping.</li>

      <li>Different vendors may have the same name for different mappings</li>

      <li>Different vendors may radically change the mappings without changing
      the name.</li>

      <li>Our users are ignorant.</li>

      <li>Our users don't want to know the details.</li>

      <li>Our "power" users do want to know the details.</li>

      <li>Our users are working with multiple platforms.</li>

      <li>Our users are using other platforms that don't have ICU, and can't
      get ICU installed on those platforms.</li>

      <li>Our users can't get Unicode to work on their legacy platforms.</li>
      <!--li>We are not a registration authority (We don't have the power to
                  randomly make up new aliases).</li -->
    </ol>

    <h2>Thoughts On What Is Needed</h2>

    <p>Logically, all of this could be supported by the following three
    mappings</p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" summary="">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Main</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>alias, platform =&gt; canonicalName</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>DefaultForCanonicalName</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>canonicalName =&gt; alias</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>DefaultForAlias</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>alias =&gt; canonicalName</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The canonical alias from UTR #22 has some drawbacks. Even though this
    is an excellent format to distinguish an alias internally, no other vender
    supports the names. We should make it easy for our user's to get an IANA,
    MIME, or some other platform/version specific name. UTR #22 also has the
    drawback that the format can conflict with existing aliases, and our users
    usually do not have an accurate way to distinguish between a canonical
    name and an alias (e.g. iso-8859-1 vs. aix-iso8859_1-4.3.6).</p>

    <p>Putting features of a codepage into a converter name (e.g. VASCII, VPUA,
    VSUB, VNLLF) may be useful for internally distinguishing the codepage
    features. However, our users generally do not know these differences
    existed, and few other platforms recognize these specially made up names.
    Our users usually know the platform and the alias (or preferred alias), but
    they don't know the features.</p>

    <p>Using the feature list for a converter name to find the appropriate
    fallback codepage is a rather difficult thing to do. Which do you try to
    fallback to first when a converter can't be opened? Do I want one that has
    the Euro update, or do I want one that works on a certain platform with
    VASCII? Our converter alias design can probably address this issue by
    allowing the user to iterate over the aliases based on a standard or
    platform name and selecting the right one depending on the features
    or the version in the canonical name.</p>

    <p>When a converter can't be opened, you probably want to try to open
    another one that worked on a given platform at one time. If the fallback
    path is wrong for a user, we can either allow the user to modify the alias
    table before build time, allow the user to progmatically modify the
    behavior, or allow the user to progmatically query the fallback path and
    let them decide on the fly.</p>

    <h2>Data Structure</h2>

    <h3>Alias Table Format</h3>

    <p>The current format is the following:</p>

    <p><a href=
    "http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/mappings/convrtrs.txt">
    http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/source/data/mappings/convrtrs.txt</a></p>

    <p>The following examples are how a new converter alias table could be
    used. While I've tried to make it complete, it's not guaranteed accurate.
    Use the examples as ways to use the new format.</p>

    <p>These aliases with the tags are going to get really long. We should
    consider allowing line wrapping. This could be done in a similar way that
    Makefiles do line wrapping. If the line starts with whitespace, then it
    must be a continuation of the previous line.</p>

    <p>One possible alias table format can look like the following in BNF. For
    the sake of simplicity, the comments, newlines and makefile style
    whitespace usage are left out of this format.</p>

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" summary=
    "BNF of alias table">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>AliasTable</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>'{' SupportedPlatform* '}'<br>
           ConverterAliases*</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>SupportedPlatform</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>[a-zA-Z_]+</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>ConverterAliases</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>CanonicalConverterName Tags* Aliases*</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>CanonicalConverterName</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+'-'[a-zA-Z0-9_]+'-'[a-zA-Z0-9_]+</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Tags</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>'{' Tag+ '}'</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Tag</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>SupportedPlatform AlternatePlatformAlias?</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>DefaultPlatformAlias</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>'*'</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Aliases</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Alias Tags*</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Alias</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>[a-zA-Z_'-']+</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The asterisk "*" is used for denoting the default alias. This may seem a little
    odd since some people may think 'zero or more' when looking and this BNF, but it
    is a literal character used as a way to denote the default alias, and it is
    usually much quicker and easier to just denote which one is the default with
    one character. We are also limited to use only invariant characters in this
    table.</p>

    <p>We could do this table as a resource bundle, but this data can get very
    large when alias versioning is considered. So we should optimize the data
    format as much as possible. We could also do this table in XML, but this
    may be difficult to include XML into out builds. We can consider exporting
    it as XML, which would be very useful when combined with XSL in order to
    generate HTML for public viewing.</p>

</samp>
</pre>

    <p>Notice that there are two Shift_JIS aliases, but only one of them is the
    default for a given tag.</p>

    <p>There should be one and only one default tag of a given type per line
    and per alias. So you can't have WINDOWS be the default for Shift_JIS on
    two different converters, and you can't have more than one the default
    alias for a converter. So the following two examples are illegal.</p>
<pre>
<samp>ibm-942_P12A
    sjis78 { SOLARIS }
    pck { SOLARIS }
</samp>
</pre>

    <p>The previous example can be fixed by properly setting the defaults
    for the aliases to the following:</p>
<pre>
<samp>ibm-942_P12A
    sjis78 { SOLARIS<font color="red">*</font> }
    pck { SOLARIS }
</samp>
</pre>

    <p>If we allowed alias versioning, we might be able to have the same standard and alias on
    different mappings tables, like the following:</p>

<pre>
<samp>ibm-942_P120
    pck { SOLARIS<font color="red">/1*</font> }
ibm-942_P12A
    pck { SOLARIS<font color="red">/2*</font> }
</samp>
</pre>

    <p>Having multiple aliases for a converter and multiple versions of that alias
    are two orthogonal ideas. So they need to be represented with different syntax.
    Having versioned aliases is useful, but most people usually want the current
    mapping. For instance most people want the current mapping of windows-1252 with
    Euro support. This is a feature would be useful, but this may be a low priority.
    Versioning would also make the internal data structure a 4 dimensional array
    (converters x standards x aliases x version).</p>



<!--    <p>Here is an example where converter alias versioning is useful.</p>
<pre>
<samp># Windows Latin1 (w/ euro update)
ibm-5348 { IBM }
    windows-1252 { IANA <font color=
"red">WINDOWS WINDOWS_98 WINDOWS_2000 WINDOWS_XP</font> }
    cp1252 { JAVA* }
    ibm-1252 { AIX }

# Windows Latin1 (w/o euro update)
ibm-1252 { IBM AIX* }
    windows-1252 { IANA* <font color=
"red">WINDOWS* WINDOWS_95 WINDOWS_NT</font> }
    cp1252 { JAVA* }

# Windows Latin1 (w/ euro update), but missing some roundtrip mappings and fallbacks.
java-Cp1252-1.3_P
    cp1252 { JAVA }
    windows-1252 { IANA* <font color=
"red">WINDOWS* WINDOWS_98* WINDOWS_2000* WINDOWS_XP*</font> }
</samp>
</pre>
-->

    <p>In order to reduce the chance of a misspelling we should consider
    requiring a list of supported tags at the beginning of the file. These tags
    should probably be case insensitive. This list can also be used to specify
    the preference for opening a converter when there are multiple aliases and
    no standard is specified (e.g. ucnv_open()).</p>

    <p>Three tags of interest are the ICU, ICU_FEATURE and ICU_CANONICAL tags.
    The ICU tags are names that ICU made up or misused and are needed for
    historical reasons, like the "cp*" tags for Windows, which are different
    from Java. The ICU_FEATURE tag is for converter aliases like
    ibm-942_VASCII_VSUB_VPUA. The ICU_CANONICAL tag is for aliases like
    ibm-916_P100-1987 and conforms to UTR #22.</p>

    <h2>Analysis of Existing API</h2>

    <p>Due to existing APIs, the platforms are called "standards" in the APIs.
    Since IANA and MIME are in the list of platforms, the name "standard" seems
    to make sense. Since standard organization names, platform vendors, and
    software products are in the list, the "standard" name seems to be a reasonable name
    within our API.</p>

    <p>The ucnv_getPlatform() function only works on open converters, and only
    returns UCNV_IBM if the codepage is IBM based. This API is inflexible due
    to its use of enums. It prevents our users from easily adding their own
    platforms/standards. Since this API ignores the fact that the same
    converter can be based on a list of platforms and standards, like UTF-8 and
    iso-8859-1, this API seems less than useful and should be considered for
    API deprecation.</p>

    <p>Slightly off topic, there is a function called ucnv_getDisplayName().
    While it seems like a useful function, it also has no data. It just returns
    the canonical name like some other APIs. We should consider deprecating
    it.</p>

    <h3>Getting a Recognized Standard's Converter Name</h3>

    <p>There is already an API to get the standard's converter name based on an
    alias and a standard. With a tag like "ICU_CANONICAL", you can also request
    the canonical name.</p>
<pre>
<samp>/**
 * Returns a standard name for a given converter name.
 *
 * @param name original converter name
 * @param standard name of the standard governing the names; MIME and IANA
 *        are such standards
 * @return returns the standard converter name;
 *         if a standard converter name cannot be determined,
 *         then <code>NULL</code> is returned. Owned by the library.
 * @stable
 */
U_CFUNC const char * U_EXPORT2
ucnv_getStandardName(const char *alias, const char *standard, UErrorCode *pErrorCode);
</samp>
</pre>

    <h3>Getting a List of Recognized Standard's</h3>

    <p>There is already an API to get the list of supported platforms. Its name
    is a little funny, but it already exists. The current API looks like the
    following:</p>
<pre>
<samp>/**
 * Gives the number of standards associated to converter names.
 * @return number of standards
 * @stable
 */
U_CAPI uint16_t U_EXPORT2
ucnv_countStandards(void);

/**
 * Gives the name of the standard at given index of standard list.
 * @param n index in standard list
 * @param pErrorCode result of operation
 * @return returns the name of the standard at given index. Owned by the library.
 * @stable
 */
U_CAPI const char * U_EXPORT2
ucnv_getStandard(uint16_t n, UErrorCode *pErrorCode);
</samp>
</pre>

    <h3>Getting a List of Converters</h3>

    <p>There is already an API to get the list of installed converters, but we
    may want a new API to get the list of known converters. The current API looks like the
    following:</p>

<pre>
<samp>/**
 * returns the number of available converters, as per the alias file.
 *
 * @return the number of available converters
 * @see ucnv_getAvailableName
 * @stable
 */
U_CAPI int32_t U_EXPORT2
ucnv_countAvailable (void);

/**
 * Gets the name of the specified converter from a list of all converters
 * contaied in the alias file.
 * @param n the index to a converter available on the system (in the range <TT>[0..ucnv_countAvaiable()]</TT>)
 * @return a pointer a string (library owned), or <TT>NULL</TT> if the index is out of bounds.
 * @see ucnv_countAvailable
 * @stable
 */
U_CAPI const char* U_EXPORT2
ucnv_getAvailableName (int32_t n);
</samp>
</pre>

    <h3>Getting a List of Aliases for a Converter</h3>

    <p>There is already an API to get the list of aliases of a converter.
    The current API looks like the following:</p>

<pre>
<samp>/**

    <h2>Possible New API Changes</h2>

    <p>Some new API will almost be required to implement. A new ucnv_open
    function will be needed, so that a codepage can be opened based upon an
    alias. It could look something like this:</p>
<pre>
<samp>/**
 * Creates a UConverter object with the names specified as a C string
 * based on a specified standard or platform.
 * The actual name will be resolved with the alias file
 * using a case-insensitive string comparison that ignores
 * the delimiters '-', '_', and ' ' (dash, underscore, and space).
 * E.g., the names "UTF8", "utf-8", and "Utf 8" are all equivalent.
 * If <code>NULL</code> is passed for the converter name, it will create
 * one with the getDefaultName return value.
 *
 * A converter name for ICU 1.5 and above may contain options
 * like a locale specification to control the specific behavior of
 * the newly instantiated converter.
 * The meaning of the options depends on the particular converter.
 * If an option is not defined for or recognized by a given converter,
 * then it is ignored.
 *
 * Options are appended to the converter name string, with a
 * <code>UCNV_OPTION_SEP_CHAR</code> between the name and the first option and
 * also between adjacent options.
 *
 * When the standard is <code>NULL</code> it will open a converter
 * that is most appropriate for the current platform. When a standard is 
 * specified, it will open a converter that is most appropriate for that 
 * standard.
 *
 * @param converterName : name of the uconv table, may have options appended
 * @param standard the specific converter behavior to use, which is specified by
 *          the alias table.
 * @param err outgoing error status <tt>U_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ERROR, U_FILE_ACCESS_ERROR</tt>
 * @return the created Unicode converter object, or <tt>NULL</tt> if an error occured
 * @see ucnv_openU
 * @see ucnv_openCCSID
 * @see ucnv_close
 * @see convrts.txt
 * @stable
 */
U_CAPI UConverter* U_EXPORT2 
ucnv_openStandard(const char *converterName, const char *standard, UErrorCode * err);
</samp>
</pre>

    <p>The ucnv_open() function will need to change its behavior a bit. It
    can open an ICU preferred converter, or it can open a platform-preferred
    converter. It would probably be better if the converter that is opened
    remained consistent across all platforms, like it is now.</p>

    <p>While the existing API does address our basic converter, some new API
    could be added for convenience. This functionality already exists by using
    the existing API. These functions may not be very fast, but these functions
    are just for convenience. This possible new API mirrors the ucnv_*Alias(),
    but it should use the new UEnumeration API.</p>
<pre>
<samp>/**
 * Return a new UEnumeration object for enumerating all the
 * alias names for a given converter that are recognized by a standard.
 * This method only enumerates the listed entries in the alias file.
 * The convrtrs.txt file can be modified to change the results of
 * this function.
 * The first result in this list is the same result given by
 * <code>ucnv_getStandardName</code>, which is the default alias for
 * the specified standard name. The returned object must be closed with
 * <code>uenum_close</code> when you are done with the object.
 *
 * @param convName original converter name
 * @param standard name of the standard governing the names; MIME and IANA
 *      are such standards
 * @param pErrorCode The error code
 * @return A UEnumeration object for getting all aliases that are recognized
 *      by a standard. If any of the parameters are invalid, NULL
 *      is returned.
 * @see ucnv_getStandardName
 * @see uenum_close
 * @see uenum_next
 * @draft ICU 2.2
 */

ucnv_openStandardNames(const char *convName,
                       const char *standard,

</samp>

    <h2>Affects of Implementing This Design</h2>

    <p>It should be easy to implement this new design without significant API
    changes. Implementing this design will require a major overhaul of the
    underlying data structure, which will take some time.</p>

    <h2>Other Suggested Improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Create an API to register new aliases for a converter in ICU. This is
      different from adding a converter to ICU, which can already be done. This
      ability exists in Java 1.4, but this ability does increase the complexity
      to the memory management in ICU4C.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>There has been some thought about putting the alias information in
      each .cnv/.ucm table, but it becomes more difficult to verify the whole
      alias table is correct. This has become very apparent with the locale
      data, where one locale's country's information was fundamentally
      different in another locale in a different language for the same country
      (de_BE and en_BE didn't have the same currency information). People also
      make typos. It is much easier to find typos when the information is in
      one file. Even running a separate tool to verify the information is
      correct can become a maintenance nightmare because few people will ever
      run it, (e.g. the LCID test program). There are also many tools that use
      the convrtrs.txt file. Some of them are in Java. So putting the alias
      information in the .cnv/.ucm files will probably be a bad idea.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>The readability could be improved if we allowed commas in the lists.
      Since the list is going to get long with a lot of tags, this may not be
      helpful.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

      <li>We could add information about converter alias fallback. This would
      be useful when the requested converter was not available, and the fallback
      alias would be used instead. This probably wouldn't be useful because the correct
      fallback path would be different depending on the system or application
      being used. The fallback path would also be different depending on wether
      the text is imported or an exported to a codepage. The best way to do
      this fallback is to allow the API user to iterate over the aliases and
      find a suitable converter. The user could differenciate between
      various converters based on the ICU canonical name.<br>
