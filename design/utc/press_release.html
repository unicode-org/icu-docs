<body style="margin: 5em">

<p><i>Mountain View, CA, March 31, 2005</i> - The Unicode® Consortium announced today the release of 
the latest version of the <i>Unicode Standard, Version 4.1.0</i>. This version adds 1,273 new 
characters, including those necessary to complete roundtrip mapping of the HKSCS and GB 18030 
standards, five new currency signs, some characters for Indic and Korean, and eight new scripts. In 
addition, there have been a number of significant additions and changes to the Unicode Character 
Database properties, which determine the behavior of characters in modern software.<br>
<br>
Unicode 4.1 adds two new Unicode Standard Annexes: <i>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/">UAX #31: Identifier and Pattern Syntax</a></i> and <i>
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr34/">UAX #34: Unicode Named Character Sequences</a></i>, 
and makes significant changes to other Unicode Standard Annexes. <i>UAX #31</i> is of particular 
interest as a result of the broader incorporation of Unicode in protocols and programming languages. 
Applications from programming languages to international domain names require stable mechanisms for 
distinguishing both identifiers and syntax characters, even as characters for additional languages 
are added to the Unicode Standard.<br>
<br>
The release of Unicode 4.1 will be soon followed by a new release of the Unicode Collation 
Algorithm, for language-sensitive sorting, searching, and matching; by Unicode Regular Expressions, 
setting the standard for handling Unicode character in regular expressions; and by a new draft of 
Unicode Security Considerations, for dealing with security issues posed by the large number of 
visually-similar characters in Unicode.<br>
<br>
For complete details on Unicode 4.1, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/4.1.0/">
http://www.unicode.org/versions/4.1.0/</a>. Those interested in the latest developments in software 
globalization can attend the next Unicode conference, April 6-8, 2005 in Berlin, Germany.<br>
<br>
<b>About the Unicode Standard</b><br>
<br>
The Unicode Standard is a fundamental component of all modern software and information technology 
protocols. It provides a uniform, universal architecture and encoding for all languages of the world 
-- with over 96,000 characters currently encoded -- and is the basis for processing, storage, and 
seamless data interchange of text data worldwide. Unicode is required by modern standards such as 
XML, Java, C#, ECMAScript (JavaScript), LDAP, CORBA 3.0, WML, IDN, etc., and is the official way to 
implement ISO/IEC 10646.<br>
<br>
