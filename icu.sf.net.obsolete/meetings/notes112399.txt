2. Website content review

a. Merge the top level page (http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/) with the project page (http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/project/).

b. API Deprecation Process
We decided to do the following,
    - Go through all the APIs and Mark them as draft, stable or deprecated.
    - To deprecate an API, the API will be taken out after 1-2 years after it's marked deprecated.  Subtle changes will happen immediately though.
    - What changes can we make when we need to chnge the version numbers?  We will limit to just to data change bug fixes to Collator, Normalizer and Converter.  Mark will send out an article regarding Collator versioning issues.
    - Need to provide guidelines for when to upgrade and how to migrate to a release.
    - Need to provide information on how to take advantage of bug fixes in different DLL versions.  (without revisioning the libraries and breaking binary changes.)

3. Feature Request Prioritization 

We decided that the parties who are interested in seeing the requests being implemented will volunteer to provide the code.  So there's no need to prioritize the list.

4. Proposal voting

None
