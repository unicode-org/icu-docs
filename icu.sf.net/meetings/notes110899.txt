After the reorganization of the ICU web site content, this work item no
longer applies.

5. Contribution process final review

Everyone agrees to keep this as open and simple as possible for now.  No
change comments to the web site have been submitted.  However, regarding
API change policy, maybe the following process should be enforced,

* Strict API addition: at least 2 week of review period on icu mailing
list.
* Breaking API changes: at least 1 week of review period on icu mailing
list.
* Keep a list mature APIs (that have been reviewed and marked as stable)
available on the web.

Review this in the next meeting.
