Minutes taker: Markus Scherer

Agenda items:
- Yves: abandonment of support for multiple versions of collation - why?
  + Vladimir: prototyping shows that runtime versioning is very complex
    and error-prone
  + Mark: data changes with most Unicode versions
  + see also discussion on the mailing list

- Yves is looking at using Unicode 2.1 data with ICU because he is
  using MS SQL Server, which limits characters to the 2.1 repertoire
  + Markus: the new normalization code may not decompose Jamos as far as old
    Unicode versions (before 2.1.9?) used to because Unicode 3.0 and later
    does not decompose them further
  + Mark: generating "Age.txt" or similar file showing when each
    character was assigned (in which Unicode version)
    This could be used to just filter out "new" characters while still processing
    with new data.

- Yves would like to move the uconv tool from icuapps to the main icu
  CVS module
  + useful tool that should be easy to access for users
  + discussed and agreed, Yves to move uconv to icu/source/extra/

- Mark: At the Unicode conference, "Transliteration" was sometimes misunderstood
  as being limited to script<->script mappings; rename to "Transform"?
  + discussed alternatives - all are equally problematic and need explanation
  + we will document what Transliteration does in the User Guide and the API References

- Yves will work on makefile fixes and improvements
