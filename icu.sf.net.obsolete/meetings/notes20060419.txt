ICU meeting 2006 Apr 19 Copyright (c) 2006 IBM and others
- Attendees:
    - Mark, Markus, Vladimir, Deborah, Doug, George, Ram, Andy, Eric,
      Michael Ow (IBM), Eric, Steven
- Copyright Assignment
    - discussed, sent to list.  All to discuss with lawyers.
- RBBI French - #1574
    - There are probably some other bugs related to this, italian
      (#3917), etc
    - Suggestion: Transfer bug to CLDR, close in ICU
    - Deborah has the action to open a CLDR bug and close the ICU bug.
- UText - iteration boundaries
    - Issue: May want to iterate over codepoints between start and
      limit. Would be convenient if the iteration code didn't have to
      call getNativeIndex at each point.
    - Question: implement this without the provider being aware of it?
    - Proposal: add field for start/end offset and keep it reserved
        - modify [to point at] chunk boundaries in access function
    - Proposal: have two areas of reserved data in UText:   One the
      providers won't touch (UText's use) , and one that providers can
      use as their scratch area, initialized to zero.
    - Andy to rough something out.
    - This current feature might want 20 bytes, make it 32 bytes?
    - Or, better to heap allocate any extra stuff.
    - Final proposal:  Pointer (for the provider?) , and some extra
      area for UText
- RBBI/UText question - Andy
    - there is an API for getting the old CharacterIterator. Doesn't
      work so well with UText..
    - Can we wrap a CharacterIterator in a UText?  yes
    - UText wrapped in CharacterIterator isn't fully implemented -
      would be a pain.
- Concern about burden of learning on UText providers -- Mark
    - There are two common cases, which could help providers
        - #1 UText user knows its going to use the entire buffer
            - (provider could make one big chunk instead of pieces)
        - #2 UText user knows it's not going to use native indexes often
            - (provider could not provide the index map)
    - Provider COULD statistically analysize...
    - It's better, for the user, to not have to make choices..
    - Proposal:  hint bits from the user to the provider, to request
      certain types of behavior.
    - Can the native index map be lazilly created?
    - Andy would like to try different things with UTF-8, and see if
      hint bits are justified.
- Summer of Code
    - IBM: Q: RBManager?  A: not interesting for Google -- May need to
      make sure it is an item which will integrate back into ICU.
    - Tradeoff: handholding has to be done. So, someone from the team
      has to be a mentor - sponsor.  Need to ask in each manager chain
      for availability to mentorship.
    - Need someone to put together a formal list
    - Students to start applying May 1st.
    - Apple: Lenient date parsing. Might be beyond what would work.
    - Google: State table based Dictionary lookup? Mark to write
      something up. Deborah's CTD is optimized for match vs. no match.
