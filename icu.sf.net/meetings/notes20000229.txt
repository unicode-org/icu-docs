Agenda:

    Action item status: 
          [r] : removed
          [-] : completed
          [ ] : open

    [-] T19991123-03 [PMC members]    ICU testing issues. 
        ->  Progress Software: Steve reported that he is having trouble
                building ICU on Solaris, AIX and HP-UX11. Helena volunteered
                to send out a build script IBM uses to build
                ICU on various platforms. 
              [-] Helena sent the runConfigureICU script, and it is also
                  checked into cvs now. See T20000208-01.
            NCR: David is working on some performance tests, the results
                will be made available through this mailing list once they
                are available.  David also mentioned that it's hard to learn
                ICU because of the insufficient documentation for APIs.
                IBM is working on a user's guide for ICU and the user's guide
                will be uploaded on the oss server once it's available.
              [ ] Creating two new action items for this, see below:
                T20000208-04 & T20000229-02
            Compuware: Bob can't attend this meeting and he will report
                on Compuware progress next week. 
              [r] Will be picked up again when Bob is back in the meetings.
    [ ] T20000125-01 [Bob]     Implement the global new/delete operator to
                               use uprv_malloc and uprv_free functions.
        -> (Bob did not attend the meeting.)
    [-] T20000208-01 [Helena] Send out a build script IBM uses to build
                              ICU on various platforms. 
        -> also checked into cvs
    [-] T20000208-02 [Helena] Send the IBM build/test contact's email
                              address to Steve Watt. 
    [ ] T20000208-03 [Brendan & Tex] Send out the requirements with regards
                              to Collation versioning to icu mailing list and
                              IBM will revise the current versioning proposal
                              to satisfy the combined requirement. 
        -> Steven Watt sent requirements, awaiting Brendan & discussion.
           Discussion: Consensus that in some form, (Locale+ID) must be unique.
           The ID needs to reflect collation-changing modifications in both
           algorithm=implementation (not locale-specific) and rules=data.
           It should be possible to instantiate an older version of a Collator.
           Discussion & design will continue.
    [ ] T20000208-04 [David]  Send out the performance test results when it's available.
        -> ICU message formatting is ca. 3x slower than Windows sprintf().
           We discussed how far this is related to Unicode (test wsprintf()?),
           dynamic memory allocation in UnicodeString (use Replaceable? improve
           UnicodeString, see jitterbug 312), and other dynamic objects like
           DigitList etc. More testing and work on UnicodeString is in progress.

- ICU 1.4 is released!

- David Craig: ICU performance for numeric formatting (see icu-core list 2000-feb-26)
  ->  See above: T20000208-04

- Additional agenda items:
  + problems building ICU 1.4 on Windows NT
    * (This seems to have been solved after the meeting: do not build with
      Platform SDK headers and tools but with VC++ 6.)
  + surrogate support with ucnv_getNextUChar() as proposed
    * Discussed in the meeting, remained unopposed.

- Action items from this meeting
    [ ] T20000229-01 [Markus] Send proposals to the icu list for
                              + basic UTF-16 support with C++
                              + Converter callback API changes
                              + 3/4-MBCS conversion
                              + Mirrored properties APIs
                              Note that there is a "Proposals" page to be
                              added to the OSS server.
    [ ] T20000229-02 [IBM]    Provide initial draft of User's Guide (icu-core)
    [ ] T20000229-03 [IBM]    Improve readme and related documents
                              + Cross-link javadoc texts, C <-> C++ etc.
                              + update readme & docs/*
                              + move coding guidelines to separate doc (only
                                link to oss server page? remove irrelevant items)
    [ ] T20000229-04 [David]  David Craig will continue to work on the DateFormat
                              performance and report in the next meeting.
    [ ] T20000229-05 [David]  Review the Format User's guide chapters
    [ ] T20000229-06 [Tex & Steve] Review the Collation and ResourceBundle User's guide chapters

- Future meeting schedule

  ->  The next ICU meeting will be held
      on 2000-Mar-21 from 9AM-10AM PST, 12PM-1PM EST.
      The call-in number and pass code will be provided at least
      24 hours prior to the meeting.
