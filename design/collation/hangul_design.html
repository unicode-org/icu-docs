<h1>Hangul Design</h1>
<p>In order to implement <i>C Interleaving Method</i> in UTS #10, here are some design thoughts. 
Very rough at this point, but we wanted to capture them. For #C, see 7.1.4.1 in
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/tr10-12.html#Trailing_Weights">
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/tr10-12.html#Trailing_Weights</a>.</p>
<h2>Reasons</h2>
<p>By using <i>C Interleaving Method</i>, for Korean we can </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>solve the Hangul weight bug, </li>
  <li>decrease sort key size</li>
  <li>increase performance substantially for both str_coll and sort keys</li>
</ol>
<h2>Basic Changes</h2>
<p>Modify Fractional UCA so that the L Jamo that can be the start of Hangul Syllables (H) are 
separated by a larger gap, and stay a 2-byte weight. All other Jamo will have 3 byte weights. What 
will happen is that each Hangul Syllable starting with Ln be mapped to a weight after the Ln Jamo.</p>
<p>The gap will be large enough that it has room for the following as three-byters. The + indicates 
a fake value, reserved for non-precomposed syllables.</p>
<p>Ln<br>
Ln+<br>
LnV0<br>
LnV0+<br>
LnV0T0<br>
LnV0T0+<br>
LnV0T1<br>
LnV0T1+<br>
...<br>
LnVmTp<br>
LnVmTp+</p>
<p>In processing, each Hangul Syllable (precomposed) will be detected (by a special flag), and 
mapped algorithmically to the right position after the appropriate L. Each non-precomposed hangul 
syllable will be detected and transformed to NFC. If the NFC result is a single character, the same 
thing happens. If not, then a new algorithmic weight is assigned, as per C. That weight will have as 
its first item, an LxVyTz+ weight. Example: LxVyVzTw will get</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" align="center">LxVy+</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center">Lx</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center">Vy</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center">Vz</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center">Tw</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center"><span class="changedspan"><font face="Arial Unicode MS">&#9417;</font></span></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>I just had a thought; since the Lx will always be identical for any LxVy+, we can skip the first 
weight, so:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" align="center">LxVy+</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center">Vy</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center">Vz</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center">Tw</td>
    <td width="15%" align="center"><span class="changedspan"><font face="Arial Unicode MS">&#9417;</font></span></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In the algorithmic assignment of the follow-on weights, the bytes have to be assigned so that
<span class="changedspan"><font face="Arial Unicode MS">&#9417;</font> &lt; T &lt;&nbsp; V &lt; L. </span>We will also 
need leave a gap in all the byte values, to allow us to do tailorings. <span class="changedspan">But 
because we need to allow for all the archaic jamo also, we will need to use 2 byters for them. 
That's ok, using the same mechanism we use elsewhere. We will get the following pattern, which we 
can fit into one byte.</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="changedspan">gap, terminator weight, </span></li>
  <li><span class="changedspan">gap, 2 x trailing count, gap, lead archaic trailing byte</span></li>
  <li><span class="changedspan">gap, 2 x vowel count, gap, lead archaic vowel byte</span></li>
  <li><span class="changedspan">gap, 2 x leading count, gap, lead archaic leading byte</span></li>
  <li><span class="changedspan">gap</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tailorings</h2>
<p>First off, we don't expect tailorings of either Hangul Syllables or Jamo. So in a first release, 
we may just disable that feature. Even in a later release our goal is to make them <i>work correctly</i>, 
but we are not going to worry about performance. Part of working correctly means that canonical 
equivalence still works, of course.</p>
<h3>Tailoring relative to an L or H.</h3>
<p>Example: &amp; H &lt; a</p>
<p>In this case, the weight for 'a' will fit into one of the gaps after an H. (Same for tailoring 
relative to an L).</p>
<h3>Tailoring a Jamo or H</h3>
<p>Example: &amp; 'a' &lt; L</p>
<p>If someone does this, we disable the above mechanism completely, and fall back to the current 
approach, plus we terminate each syllable with a <span class="changedspan">
<font face="Arial Unicode MS">&#9417; </font></span>value (see B in UTS #10).</p>
