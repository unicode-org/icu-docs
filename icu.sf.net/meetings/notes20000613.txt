- Documentation update.

Roger mentioned that a draft version of the ICU user's guide will be available before the end of this month, June 2000.  David C. 
pointed out the C++ examples are in much better shape than the C examples.  Once the user's guide draft is completed, a PDF format 
version will also be available on the OSS server for public review.

- Technical discussion
     1. IANA name structure.
         Since Yves was not able to attend the meeting, this will be postponed until the next meeting.
     2. Tool package mechanism.
        Steven briefly discussed what the packaging mechanism is for.  The consensus is to proceed with
the proposal and integrate that into 1.6 release plan.
     3. Alias matching mechnism.
        All agreed that the proposal is valid, the following options were further discussed,
        a. Match only alphanumerics and ignore anything else. 
           Pros: easy to implement and maintain.
           Cons: Can result very inconsistent name to be matched, e.g. "?U?T(F)-=8" can be matched with 
           "UTF8".  (Helena)
        b. Match with a pattern with special wildchar characters, namely '-', '_' (or maybe even ' ') and ':'.  
           Pros: Specify with pattern is commonly used in ICU already.  This also avoids the ugly name 
                 matching as in a.
           Cons: Extra parsing code will be required.  Steve W. pointed out that the name without any
                 wildchar can result names that are very hard to read, e.g. "ISO88591" and "ISO885915".  
                 Helena mentioned that this already exists on HP when one types "locale charmap" under
                 command line.  The names returned on HP can be completely striped of punctuations.
           Yves (by email): Should make the wildchar match each other.  
           Helena: Prefer having the wildchar of '-' and '_' (possibly ' ') to match each other.  But, ':'
                   should not be matched with just any wildchar.
        Markus will send out a revised proposal and solicit votes on it this week.
     4. IANA names structure.
         This discussion will be postponed until next meeting when Yves
and Mark can attend.
