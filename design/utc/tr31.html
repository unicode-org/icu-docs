  <p>A common task facing an implementer of the Unicode Standard is the provision of a parsing 
  and/or lexing engine for identifiers. To assist in the standard treatment of identifiers in 
  Unicode character-based parsers, a set of specifications is provided here as a recommended default 
  for the definition of identifier syntax. These guidelines are no more complex than current rules 
  in the common programming languages, except that they include more characters of different types.
  </p>
  <p>In addition, this document provides a proposed definition of a set of properties for use in 
  defining stable pattern syntax: syntax that is stable over future versions of the Unicode 
  Standard.</p>

  <h2>2. <a name="Default_Identifier_Syntax">Default Identifier Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>The formal syntax provided here is intended to capture the general intent that an identifier 
  consists of a string of characters that begins with a letter or an ideograph, and then includes 
  any number of letters, ideographs, digits, or underscores. Each programming language standard has 
  its own identifier syntax; different programming languages have different conventions for the use 
  of certain characters from the ASCII range ($, @, #, _) in identifiers. To extend such a syntax to 
  cover the full behavior of a Unicode implementation, implementers need only combine these specific 
  rules with the syntax provided here. </p>
  <h4>D1. Default Identifier Syntax</h4>
  <p><code>&lt;identifier&gt; := <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&lt;identifier_start&gt; &lt;identifier_continue&gt;*</span></code><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
  </span></p>
  <p>Identifiers are defined by the following sets of character categories from the Unicode 
  Character Database.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The innovations in the identifier syntax to cover the Unicode Standard include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incorporation of proper handling of combining marks </li>
    <li>Allowance for layout and format control characters, which should be ignored when parsing 
    identifiers</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.1 Combining Marks</h3>
  <p>Combining marks are accounted for in identifier syntax. A composed character sequence 
  consisting of a base character followed by any number of combining marks must be valid for an 
  identifier. This requirement results from the requirement for combining marks in the 
  representation of many languages, and the conformance rules in Chapter 3 regarding interpretation 
  of canonical-equivalent character sequences. </p>
  <p>Enclosing combining marks (for example, <code>U+20DD..U+20E0</code>) are excluded from the 
  syntactic definition of <code>&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</code>, because the composite characters that 
  result from their composition with letters (for example, U+24B6
  <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">circled latin capital letter a</span>) are themselves not 
  normally considered valid constituents of these identifiers.</p>
  <h3>2.2 Layout and Format Control Characters</h3>
  <p>The Unicode characters that are used to control joining behavior, bidirectional ordering 
  control, and alternative formats for display are explicitly defined as not affecting breaking 
  behavior. Unlike space characters or other delimiters, they do not serve to indicate word, line, 
  or other unit boundaries. Accordingly, they should normally be ignored for the purposes of 
  identifier definition. Implementations that cannot ignore characters in identifiers should exclude 
  these characters. </p>
  <h3>2.3 Specific Character Adjustments</h3>
  <p>Specific identifier syntaxes can be treated as tailorings of the generic syntax based on 
  character properties. For example, SQL identifiers allow an underscore as an identifier part (but 
  not as an identifier start); C identifiers allow an underscore as either an identifier part or an 
  identifier start. Specific languages may also want to exclude the characters that have a <code>
  decomposition_type</code> other than <code>canonical</code> or <code>none</code>, or to exclude 
  some subset of those, such as those with a <code>decomposition_type</code> equal to <code>font</code>.
  </p>
  <p>For programming language identifiers, <span class="changed">normalization and case have a 
  number of important implications. For a discussion of these issues, see </span>
  <a href="#normalization_and_case"><span class="changed">Normalization and Case</span></a><span class="changed">.</span></p>
  <h3>2.4 Backward Compatibility</h3>
  <p>Unicode General Category values are kept as stable as possible, but they can change across 
  versions of the Unicode Standard. The Other_ID_Start property contains a small list of characters 
  that qualified as <code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code> characters in some previous version of Unicode 
  solely on the basis of their General Category properties, but that no longer qualify in the 
  current version. In Unicode 4.0, this list consists of four characters: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>U+2118 <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">script capital p</span> </li>
    <li>U+212E <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">estimated symbol</span> </li>
    <li>U+309B <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">katakana-hiragana voiced sound mark</span>
    </li>
    <li>U+309C <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">katakana-hiragana semi-voiced sound mark</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="changed">Similarly, the Other_ID_Continue property contains a small list of characters 
  that qualified as <code>&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</code> characters in some previous version of 
  Unicode solely on the basis of their General Category properties, but that no longer qualify in 
  the current version.</p>
  <p>The Other_ID_Start and <span class="changed">Other_ID_Continue</span><span class="changed"> 
  properties are</span> thus designed to ensure that the Unicode identifier specification is 
  backward compatible: Any sequence of characters that qualified as an identifier in some version of 
  Unicode will continue to qualify as an identifier in future versions.</p>

  <h2>3. <a name="Alternative_Identifier_Syntax">Alternative Identifier Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>The down-side of working with the syntactic classes defined above is the storage space needed 
  for the detailed definitions, plus the fact that with each new version of the Unicode Standard new 
  characters are added, which an existing parser would not be able to recognize. In other words, the 
  recommendations based on that table are not upwardly compatible. </p>
  <p>One method to address this problem is to turn the question around. Instead of defining the set 
  of code points that are allowed, define a small, fixed set of code points that are reserved for 
  syntactic use and allow everything else (including unassigned code points) as part of an 
  identifier. All parsers written to this specification would behave the same way for all versions 
  of the Unicode Standard, because the classification of code points is fixed forever. </p>
  <p>The drawback of this method is that it allows “nonsense” to be part of identifiers because the 
  concerns of lexical classification and of human intelligibility are separated. Human 
  intelligibility can, however, be addressed by other means, such as usage guidelines that encourage 
  a restriction to meaningful terms for identifiers. For an example of such guidelines, see the XML 
  1.1 specification by the W3C [<a href="#XML1.1">XML1.1</a>]. </p>
  <p>By increasing the set of disallowed characters, a reasonably intuitive recommendation for 
  identifiers can be achieved. This approach uses the full specification of identifier classes, as 
  of a particular version of the Unicode Standard, and permanently disallows any characters not 
  recommended in that version for inclusion in identifiers. All code points unassigned as of that 
  version would be allowed in identifiers, so that any future additions to the standard would 
  already be accounted for. This approach ensures both upwardly compatible identifier stability and 
  a reasonable division of characters into those that do and do not make human sense as part of 
  identifiers. </p>
  <p>Some additional extensions to the list of disallowed code points can be made to further 
  constrain “unnatural” identifiers. For example, one could include unassigned code points in blocks 
  of characters set aside for future encoding as symbols, such as mathematical operators. </p>
  <p>With or without such fine-tuning, such a compromise approach still incurs the expense of 
  implementing large lists of code points. While they no longer change over time, it is a matter of 
  choice whether the benefit of enforcing somewhat word-like identifiers justifies their cost.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, one can use the properties described below, and allow all sequences of 
  characters to be identifiers that are neither pattern syntax nor pattern whitespace. This has the 
  advantage of simplicity and small tables, but allows many more “unnatural” identifiers.</p>

      characters that are added to or removed from the sets of code points defined by these 
      properties.<br>
&nbsp; </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h2>4. <a name="Pattern_Syntax">Pattern Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>There are many circumstances where software interprets patterns that are a mixture of literal 
  characters, whitespace, and syntax characters. Examples include regular expressions, Java 
  collation rules, Excel or ICU number formats, and many others. These patterns have been very 
  limited in the past, and forced to use clumsy combinations of ASCII characters for their syntax. 
  As Unicode becomes ubiquitous, some of these will start to use non-ASCII characters for their 
  syntax: first as more readable optional alternatives, then eventually as the standard syntax.</p>
  <p>For forwards and backwards compatibility, it is very advantageous to have a fixed set of 
  whitespace and syntax code points for use in patterns. This follows the recommendations that the 
  Unicode Consortium made regarding completely stable identifiers, and the practice that is seen in 
  XML 1.1 [<a href="#XML1.1">XML1.1</a>]. (In particular, the consortium committed to not allocating 
  characters suitable for identifiers in the range 2190..2BFF, which is being used by XML 1.1.)</p>
  <p>With a fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points, a pattern language can then have a 
  policy requiring all possible syntax characters (even ones currently unused) to be quoted if they 
  are literals. By using this policy, it preserves the freedom to extend the syntax in the future by 
  using those characters. Past patterns on future systems will always work; future patterns on past 
  systems will signal an error instead of silently producing the wrong results.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Example:</i></p>
    <p>In version 1.3 of program X, &#39;≈&#39; is a reserved syntax character, e.g. it doesn&#39;t perform an 
    operation, but you have to quote it. In version 1.4, &#39;≈&#39; gets a real meaning, e.g. uppercase the 
    subsequent characters. In this example, &#39;\&#39; <i>quotes</i> the next character; i.e., causes it to 
    be treated as a literal instead of a syntax character.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The pattern abc...\≈...xyz works on both version 1.3 and 1.4, and refers to the literal 
      character since it is quoted in both cases. </li>
      <li>The pattern abc...≈...xyz works on 1.1 and uppercases the following characters. On version 
      1.0, the engine (rightfully) has no idea what to do with ≈. Rather than silently fail (by 
      ignoring ≈ or turning it into a literal), it has the opportunity signal an error.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This document describes set of code points that can be used for such pattern whitespace and 
  syntax characters. Particular pattern languages may, of course, override these recommendations 
  (for example, adding or removing other characters for compatibility in ASCII). But by providing a 
  list of these in UCD properties, a stable, common basis for future expansion.</p>
  <p>For stability, the property values are absolutely invariant; not changing with successive 
  versions of Unicode. Of course, this doesn&#39;t limit the ability of the Unicode Standard to add more 
  symbol or whitespace characters, but the syntax and whitespace characters recommended for use in 
  patterns would not change.</p>
  <p>When <i>generating</i> rules or patterns, all whitespace and syntax code points that are to be 
  literals would require quoting (using whatever quoting mechanism is available). For readability, 
  it is recommended practice to quote or escape all literal whitespace and default ignorable code 
  points as well.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Example: </i>consider the following, where the items in angle brackets indicate literal 
    characters.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a<span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;SPACE&gt;</span>b =&gt; x<span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;ZERO 
      WIDTH SPACE&gt;</span>y&nbsp; + z;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since <span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;SPACE&gt;</span> is a Pattern_White_Space 
    character, it would require quoting. Since <span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;ZERO WIDTH 
    SPACE&gt;</span> is a default ignorable character, it should also be quoted for readability. So if 
    in this example \uXXXX is used for hex expression, but resolved before quoting, and single 
    quotes are used for quoting, this might be expressed as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&#39;a\u0020b&#39; =&gt; &#39;x\u200By&#39; + z;</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>4.1 Proposed Pattern Properties</h3>
  <p>The two pattern properties are named Pattern_White_Space and Pattern_Syntax. The contents are 
  presented here for review; they would be removed once incorporated into the [<a href="#UCD">UCD</a>]. 
  The contents were derived as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The proposed Pattern_White_Space characters were <i>originally </i>derived from White_Space 
    by removing some characters that appeared inappropriate for patterns, and adding LRM and RLM. 
    However, once we settle on their contents, they would be immutable from then on.<ul>
      <li>The LRM and RLM are added so as to allow easier use of Arabic and Hebrew in Patterns. For 
      example, a rule like:<p>X / W =&gt; Y* / Z ;</p>
      <p>becomes almost unreadable when some of the W..Z are right-to-left (RTL) characters (e.g. 
      Arabic or Hebrew) and others are left-to-right (LTR) characters. However, by surrounding the 
      RTL strings by LRM (or the LTR characters by RLM), the rules can be made readable.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The proposed Pattern_Syntax code points were derived from the following set, then some 
    script-specific characters were removed, along with some other characters that appeared 
    inappropriate for patterns.<ul>
      <li>[[:gc=s:] | [:gc=p:] | [\u2190-\u2BFF]]</li>

  <p><span class="changed">If programming languages are using </span><span class="changed">NFKC</span><span class="changed"> 
  to level (&quot;fold&quot;) differences between characters, then they use the following modification of the 
  identifier syntax from the Unicode Standard to deal with the idiosyncrasies of a small number of 
  characters. These characters fall into three classes:</span></p>
  <h3><span class="changed">NFKC Modifications</span></h3>
  <ol>
    <li><b><span class="changed">Middle Dot. </span></b><span class="changed">Because most Catalan 
    legacy data will be encoded in Latin-1, </span><code><span class="changed">U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT</span></code><span class="changed"> 
    needs to be allowed in </span><code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</span></code><span class="changed">. 
    (If the programming language is using a dot as an operator, then </span><code>
    <span class="changed">U+2219 BULLET OPERATOR</span></code><span class="changed"> or </span>
    <code><span class="changed">U+22C5 DOT OPERATOR</span></code><span class="changed"> should be 
    used instead. However, care should be taken when dealing with </span><code>
    <span class="changed">U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT</span></code><span class="changed">, as many processes 
    will assume its use as punctuation, rather than as a letter extender.) </span></li>
    <li><b><span class="changed">Combining-like characters. </span></b><span class="changed">Certain 
    characters are not formally combining characters, although they behave in most respects as if 
    they were. Ideally, they should not be in </span><code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span class="changed">, 
    but rather in </span><code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</span></code><span class="changed">, 
    along with combining characters. In most cases, the mismatch does not cause a problem, but when 
    these characters have compatibility decompositions, they can cause identifiers not to be closed 
    under Normalization Form KC. In particular, the following four characters are to be in </span>
    <code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</span></code><span class="changed"> and not
    </span><code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span class="changed">:

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><span class="changed">Irregularly decomposing characters. </span></b><code>
    <span class="changed">U+037A GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI</span></code><span class="changed"> and certain 
    Arabic presentation forms have irregular compatibility decompositions, and must be excluded from 
    both </span><code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span class="changed"> 
    and </span><code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</span></code><span class="changed">. 
    It is recommended that all Arabic presentation forms be excluded from identifiers in any event, 
    although only a few of them are required to be excluded for normalization to guarantee 
    identifier closure. </span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="changed">With these amendments to the identifier syntax, all identifiers are 
  closed under all four Normalization forms. This means that for any string S,</span></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span class="changed">isIdentifier(S) implies</span></code></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span class="changed">isIdentifier(toNFD(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFC(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFKD(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFKC(S))</span></code></p>
  <p><span class="changed">Identifiers are also closed under case operations (with one exception), 
  so that for any string S,</span></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span class="changed">&nbsp;isIdentifier(S) implies</span></code></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span class="changed">isIdentifier(toLowercase(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toUppercase(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toFoldedcase(S))</span></code></p>
  <p><span class="changed">The one exception is </span><code><span class="changed">U+0345 COMBINING 
  GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI</span></code><span class="changed">. In the very unusual case that </span>
  <code><span class="changed">U+0345</span></code><span class="changed"> is at the start of S,&nbsp;
  </span><code><span class="changed">U+0345</span></code><span class="changed"> is not in </span>
  <code><span class="changed">&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span class="changed">, but its 
  uppercase and case-folder version are. In practice this is not a problem, because of the way 
  normalization is used with identifiers.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><span class="changed">Note: </span></b><span class="changed">Those programming languages
