<div class="block"><code>Transliterator</code> is an abstract class that transliterates text from one format to another. The most common
 kind of transliterator is a script, or alphabet, transliterator. For example, a Russian to Latin transliterator
 changes Russian text written in Cyrillic characters to phonetically equivalent Latin characters. It does not
 <em>translate</em> Russian to English! Transliteration, unlike translation, operates on characters, without reference
 to the meanings of words and sentences.

 <p>
 Although script conversion is its most common use, a transliterator can actually perform a more general class of
 tasks. In fact, <code>Transliterator</code> defines a very general API which specifies only that a segment of the
 input text is replaced by new text. The particulars of this conversion are determined entirely by subclasses of
 <code>Transliterator</code>.

 <p>
 <b>Transliterators are stateless</b>

 <p>
 <code>Transliterator</code> objects are <em>stateless</em>; they retain no information between calls to
 <code>transliterate()</code>. As a result, threads may share transliterators without synchronizing them. This might
 seem to limit the complexity of the transliteration operation. In practice, subclasses perform complex
 transliterations by delaying the replacement of text until it is known that no other replacements are possible. In
 other words, although the <code>Transliterator</code> objects are stateless, the source text itself embodies all the
 needed information, and delayed operation allows arbitrary complexity.

 <p>
 <b>Batch transliteration</b>

 <p>
 The simplest way to perform transliteration is all at once, on a string of existing text. This is referred to as
 <em>batch</em> transliteration. For example, given a string <code>input</code> and a transliterator <code>t</code>,
 the call

 <blockquote><code>String result = t.transliterate(input);
 </code></blockquote>

 will transliterate it and return the result. Other methods allow the client to specify a substring to be
 transliterated and to use <a href="../../../../com/ibm/icu/text/Replaceable.html" title="interface in com.ibm.icu.text"><code>Replaceable</code></a> objects instead of strings, in order to preserve out-of-band
 information (such as text styles).

 <p>
 <b>Keyboard transliteration</b>

 <p>
 Somewhat more involved is <em>keyboard</em>, or incremental transliteration. This is the transliteration of text that
 is arriving from some source (typically the user's keyboard) one character at a time, or in some other piecemeal
 fashion.

 <p>
 In keyboard transliteration, a <code>Replaceable</code> buffer stores the text. As text is inserted, as much as
 possible is transliterated on the fly. This means a GUI that displays the contents of the buffer may show text being
 modified as each new character arrives.

 <p>
 Consider the simple rule-based Transliterator:

 <blockquote><code>
 th&gt;{theta}<br>
 t&gt;{tau}
 </code></blockquote>

 When the user types 't', nothing will happen, since the transliterator is waiting to see if the next character is
 'h'. To remedy this, we introduce the notion of a cursor, marked by a '|' in the output string:

 <blockquote><code>
 t&gt;|{tau}<br>
 {tau}h&gt;{theta}
 </code></blockquote>

 Now when the user types 't', tau appears, and if the next character is 'h', the tau changes to a theta. This is
 accomplished by maintaining a cursor position (independent of the insertion point, and invisible in the GUI) across
 calls to <code>transliterate()</code>. Typically, the cursor will be coincident with the insertion point, but in a
 case like the one above, it will precede the insertion point.

 <p>
 Keyboard transliteration methods maintain a set of three indices that are updated with each call to
 <code>transliterate()</code>, including the cursor, start, and limit. These indices are changed by the method, and
 they are passed in and out via a Position object. The <code>start</code> index marks the beginning of the substring
 that the transliterator will look at. It is advanced as text becomes committed (but it is not the committed index;
 that's the <code>cursor</code>). The <code>cursor</code> index, described above, marks the point at which the
 transliterator last stopped, either because it reached the end, or because it required more characters to
 disambiguate between possible inputs. The <code>cursor</code> can also be explicitly set by rules.
 Any characters before the <code>cursor</code> index are frozen; future keyboard
 transliteration calls within this input sequence will not change them. New text is inserted at the <code>limit</code>
 index, which marks the end of the substring that the transliterator looks at.

 <p>
 Because keyboard transliteration assumes that more characters are to arrive, it is conservative in its operation. It
 only transliterates when it can do so unambiguously. Otherwise it waits for more characters to arrive. When the
 client code knows that no more characters are forthcoming, perhaps because the user has performed some input
 termination operation, then it should call <code>finishTransliteration()</code> to complete any pending
 transliterations.

 <p>
 <b>Inverses</b>

 <p>
 Pairs of transliterators may be inverses of one another. For example, if transliterator <b>A</b> transliterates
 characters by incrementing their Unicode value (so "abc" -&gt; "def"), and transliterator <b>B</b> decrements character
 values, then <b>A</b> is an inverse of <b>B</b> and vice versa. If we compose <b>A</b> with <b>B</b> in a compound
 transliterator, the result is the indentity transliterator, that is, a transliterator that does not change its input
 text.

 The <code>Transliterator</code> method <code>getInverse()</code> returns a transliterator's inverse, if one exists,
 or <code>null</code> otherwise. However, the result of <code>getInverse()</code> usually will <em>not</em> be a true
 mathematical inverse. This is because true inverse transliterators are difficult to formulate. For example, consider
 two transliterators: <b>AB</b>, which transliterates the character 'A' to 'B', and <b>BA</b>, which transliterates
 'B' to 'A'. It might seem that these are exact inverses, since

 <blockquote>"A" x <b>AB</b> -&gt; "B"<br>
 "B" x <b>BA</b> -&gt; "A"</blockquote>

 where 'x' represents transliteration. However,

 <blockquote>"ABCD" x <b>AB</b> -&gt; "BBCD"<br>
 "BBCD" x <b>BA</b> -&gt; "AACD"</blockquote>

 so <b>AB</b> composed with <b>BA</b> is not the identity. Nonetheless, <b>BA</b> may be usefully considered to be
 <b>AB</b>'s inverse, and it is on this basis that <b>AB</b><code>.getInverse()</code> could legitimately return
 <b>BA</b>.

 <p>
 <b>Filtering</b>
 <p>Each transliterator has a filter, which restricts changes to those characters selected by the filter. The
 filter affects just the characters that are changed -- the characters outside of the filter are still part of the
 context for the filter. For example, in the following even though 'x' is filtered out, and doesn't convert to y, it does affect the conversion of 'a'.

 <pre>
 String rules = &quot;x &gt; y; x{a} &gt; b; &quot;;
 Transliterator tempTrans = Transliterator.createFromRules(&quot;temp&quot;, rules, Transliterator.FORWARD);
 tempTrans.setFilter(new UnicodeSet(&quot;[a]&quot;));
 String tempResult = tempTrans.transform(&quot;xa&quot;);
 // results in &quot;xb&quot;
</pre>
 <p>
 <b>IDs and display names</b>

 <p>
 A transliterator is designated by a short identifier string or <em>ID</em>. IDs follow the format
 <em>source-destination</em>, where <em>source</em> describes the entity being replaced, and <em>destination</em>
 describes the entity replacing <em>source</em>. The entities may be the names of scripts, particular sequences of
 characters, or whatever else it is that the transliterator converts to or from. For example, a transliterator from
 Russian to Latin might be named "Russian-Latin". A transliterator from keyboard escape sequences to Latin-1
 characters might be named "KeyboardEscape-Latin1". By convention, system entity names are in English, with the
 initial letters of words capitalized; user entity names may follow any format so long as they do not contain dashes.

 <p>
 In addition to programmatic IDs, transliterator objects have display names for presentation in user interfaces,
 returned by <a href="../../../../com/ibm/icu/text/Transliterator.html#getDisplayName-java.lang.String-"><code>getDisplayName(java.lang.String)</code></a>.

 <p>
 <b>Factory methods and registration</b>

 <p>
 In general, client code should use the factory method <code>getInstance()</code> to obtain an instance of a
 transliterator given its ID. Valid IDs may be enumerated using <code>getAvailableIDs()</code>. Since transliterators
 are stateless, multiple calls to <code>getInstance()</code> with the same ID will return the same object.

 <p>
 In addition to the system transliterators registered at startup, user transliterators may be registered by calling
 <code>registerInstance()</code> at run time. To register a transliterator subclass without instantiating it (until it
 is needed), users may call <code>registerClass()</code>.

 <p>
 <b>Composed transliterators</b>

 <p>
 In addition to built-in system transliterators like "Latin-Greek", there are also built-in <em>composed</em>
 transliterators. These are implemented by composing two or more component transliterators. For example, if we have
 scripts "A", "B", "C", and "D", and we want to transliterate between all pairs of them, then we need to write 12
 transliterators: "A-B", "A-C", "A-D", "B-A",..., "D-A", "D-B", "D-C". If it is possible to convert all scripts to an
 intermediate script "M", then instead of writing 12 rule sets, we only need to write 8: "A~M", "B~M", "C~M", "D~M",
 "M~A", "M~B", "M~C", "M~D". (This might not seem like a big win, but it's really 2<em>n</em> vs. <em>n</em>
 <sup>2</sup> - <em>n</em>, so as <em>n</em> gets larger the gain becomes significant. With 9 scripts, it's 18 vs. 72
 rule sets, a big difference.) Note the use of "~" rather than "-" for the script separator here; this indicates that
 the given transliterator is intended to be composed with others, rather than be used as is.

 <p>
 Composed transliterators can be instantiated as usual. For example, the system transliterator "Devanagari-Gujarati"
 is a composed transliterator built internally as "Devanagari~InterIndic;InterIndic~Gujarati". When this
 transliterator is instantiated, it appears externally to be a standard transliterator (e.g., getID() returns
 "Devanagari-Gujarati").

 <p>
 <b>Subclassing</b>

 <p>
 Subclasses must implement the abstract method <code>handleTransliterate()</code>.
 <p>
 Subclasses should override the <code>transliterate()</code> method taking a <code>Replaceable</code> and the
 <code>transliterate()</code> method taking a <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuffer</code> if the performance of
 these methods can be improved over the performance obtained by the default implementations in this class.

 <p><b>Rule syntax</b>

 <p>A set of rules determines how to perform translations.
 Rules within a rule set are separated by semicolons (';').
 To include a literal semicolon, prefix it with a backslash ('\').
 Unicode Pattern_White_Space is ignored.
 If the first non-blank character on a line is '#',
 the entire line is ignored as a comment.

 <p>Each set of rules consists of two groups, one forward, and one
 reverse. This is a convention that is not enforced; rules for one
 direction may be omitted, with the result that translations in
 that direction will not modify the source text. In addition,
 bidirectional forward-reverse rules may be specified for
 symmetrical transformations.

 <p>Note: Another description of the Transliterator rule syntax is available in
 <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-general.html#Transform_Rules_Syntax">section
 Transform Rules Syntax of UTS #35: Unicode LDML</a>.
 The rules are shown there using arrow symbols ← and → and ↔.
 ICU supports both those and the equivalent ASCII symbols &lt; and &gt; and &lt;&gt;.

 <p>Rule statements take one of the following forms:

 <dl>
     <dt><code>$alefmadda=\\u0622;</code></dt>
     <dd><strong>Variable definition.</strong> The name on the
         left is assigned the text on the right. In this example,
         after this statement, instances of the left hand name,
         &quot;<code>$alefmadda</code>&quot;, will be replaced by
         the Unicode character U+0622. Variable names must begin
         with a letter and consist only of letters, digits, and
         underscores. Case is significant. Duplicate names cause
         an exception to be thrown, that is, variables cannot be
         redefined. The right hand side may contain well-formed
         text of any length, including no text at all (&quot;<code>$empty=;</code>&quot;).
         The right hand side may contain embedded <code>UnicodeSet</code>
         patterns, for example, &quot;<code>$softvowel=[eiyEIY]</code>&quot;.</dd>
     <dt><code>ai&gt;$alefmadda;</code></dt>
     <dd><strong>Forward translation rule.</strong> This rule
         states that the string on the left will be changed to the
         string on the right when performing forward
         transliteration.</dd>
     <dt><code>ai&lt;$alefmadda;</code></dt>
     <dd><strong>Reverse translation rule.</strong> This rule
         states that the string on the right will be changed to
         the string on the left when performing reverse
         transliteration.</dd>
 </dl>

 <dl>
     <dt><code>ai&lt;&gt;$alefmadda;</code></dt>
     <dd><strong>Bidirectional translation rule.</strong> This
         rule states that the string on the right will be changed
         to the string on the left when performing forward
         transliteration, and vice versa when performing reverse
         transliteration.</dd>
 </dl>

 <p>Translation rules consist of a <em>match pattern</em> and an <em>output
 string</em>. The match pattern consists of literal characters,
 optionally preceded by context, and optionally followed by
 context. Context characters, like literal pattern characters,
 must be matched in the text being transliterated. However, unlike
 literal pattern characters, they are not replaced by the output
 text. For example, the pattern &quot;<code>abc{def}</code>&quot;
 indicates the characters &quot;<code>def</code>&quot; must be
 preceded by &quot;<code>abc</code>&quot; for a successful match.
 If there is a successful match, &quot;<code>def</code>&quot; will
 be replaced, but not &quot;<code>abc</code>&quot;. The final '<code>}</code>'
 is optional, so &quot;<code>abc{def</code>&quot; is equivalent to
 &quot;<code>abc{def}</code>&quot;. Another example is &quot;<code>{123}456</code>&quot;
 (or &quot;<code>123}456</code>&quot;) in which the literal
 pattern &quot;<code>123</code>&quot; must be followed by &quot;<code>456</code>&quot;.

 <p>The output string of a forward or reverse rule consists of
 characters to replace the literal pattern characters. If the
 output string contains the character '<code>|</code>', this is
 taken to indicate the location of the <em>cursor</em> after
 replacement. The cursor is the point in the text at which the
 next replacement, if any, will be applied. The cursor is usually
 placed within the replacement text; however, it can actually be
 placed into the precending or following context by using the
 special character '@'. Examples:

 <pre>
     a {foo} z &gt; | @ bar; # foo -&gt; bar, move cursor before a
     {foo} xyz &gt; bar @@|; #&nbsp;foo -&gt; bar, cursor between y and z
 </pre>

 <p><b>UnicodeSet</b>

 <p><code>UnicodeSet</code> patterns may appear anywhere that
 makes sense. They may appear in variable definitions.
 Contrariwise, <code>UnicodeSet</code> patterns may themselves
 contain variable references, such as &quot;<code>$a=[a-z];$not_a=[^$a]</code>&quot;,
 or &quot;<code>$range=a-z;$ll=[$range]</code>&quot;.

 <p><code>UnicodeSet</code> patterns may also be embedded directly
 into rule strings. Thus, the following two rules are equivalent:

 <pre>
     $vowel=[aeiou]; $vowel&gt;'*'; # One way to do this
     [aeiou]&gt;'*'; # Another way
 </pre>

 <p>See <a href="../../../../com/ibm/icu/text/UnicodeSet.html" title="class in com.ibm.icu.text"><code>UnicodeSet</code></a> for more documentation and examples.

 <p><b>Segments</b>

 <p>Segments of the input string can be matched and copied to the
 output string. This makes certain sets of rules simpler and more
 general, and makes reordering possible. For example:

 <pre>
     ([a-z]) &gt; $1 $1; # double lowercase letters
     ([:Lu:]) ([:Ll:]) &gt; $2 $1; # reverse order of Lu-Ll pairs
 </pre>

 <p>The segment of the input string to be copied is delimited by
 &quot;<code>(</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>)</code>&quot;. Up to
 nine segments may be defined. Segments may not overlap. In the
 output string, &quot;<code>$1</code>&quot; through &quot;<code>$9</code>&quot;
 represent the input string segments, in left-to-right order of
 definition.

 <p><b>Anchors</b>

 <p>Patterns can be anchored to the beginning or the end of the text. This is done with the
 special characters '<code>^</code>' and '<code>$</code>'. For example:

 <pre>
   ^ a&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 'BEG_A'; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match 'a' at start of text
   &nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 'A'; # match other instances of 'a'
   &nbsp; z $ &gt; 'END_Z'; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match 'z' at end of text
   &nbsp; z&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 'Z';&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # match other instances of 'z'
 </pre>

 <p>It is also possible to match the beginning or the end of the text using a <code>UnicodeSet</code>.
 This is done by including a virtual anchor character '<code>$</code>' at the end of the
 set pattern. Although this is usually the match chafacter for the end anchor, the set will
 match either the beginning or the end of the text, depending on its placement. For
 example:

 <pre>
   $x = [a-z$]; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match 'a' through 'z' OR anchor
   $x 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 2;&nbsp;&nbsp; # match '1' after a-z or at the start
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 $x &gt; 4; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match '3' before a-z or at the end
 </pre>

 <p><b>Example</b>

 <p>The following example rules illustrate many of the features of
 the rule language.

 <table border="0" cellpadding="4">
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rule 1.</td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>abc{def}&gt;x|y</code></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rule 2.</td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>xyz&gt;r</code></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rule 3.</td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>yz&gt;q</code></td>
     </tr>
 </table>

 <p>Applying these rules to the string &quot;<code>adefabcdefz</code>&quot;
 yields the following results:

 <table border="0" cellpadding="4">
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>|adefabcdefz</code></td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Initial state, no rules match. Advance
         cursor.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>a|defabcdefz</code></td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Still no match. Rule 1 does not match
         because the preceding context is not present.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>ad|efabcdefz</code></td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Still no match. Keep advancing until
         there is a match...</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>ade|fabcdefz</code></td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">...</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adef|abcdefz</code></td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">...</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adefa|bcdefz</code></td>
         <td style="vertical-align: top;">...</td>
     </tr>

 </table>

 <p>The order of rules is significant. If multiple rules may match
 at some point, the first matching rule is applied.

 <p>Forward and reverse rules may have an empty output string.
 Otherwise, an empty left or right hand side of any statement is a
 syntax error.

 <p>Single quotes are used to quote any character other than a
 digit or letter. To specify a single quote itself, inside or
 outside of quotes, use two single quotes in a row. For example,
 the rule &quot;<code>'&gt;'&gt;o''clock</code>&quot; changes the
 string &quot;<code>&gt;</code>&quot; to the string &quot;<code>o'clock</code>&quot;.

 <p><b>Notes</b>

 <p>While a Transliterator is being built from rules, it checks that
 the rules are added in proper order. For example, if the rule
 &quot;a&gt;x&quot; is followed by the rule &quot;ab&gt;y&quot;,
 then the second rule will throw an exception. The reason is that
 the second rule can never be triggered, since the first rule
 always matches anything it matches. In other words, the first
 rule <em>masks</em> the second rule.</div>

<div class="block">Transliterates the portion of the text buffer that can be
 transliterated unambiguosly after new text has been inserted,
 typically as a result of a keyboard event.  The new text in
 <code>insertion</code> will be inserted into <code>text</code>
 at <code>index.contextLimit</code>, advancing
 <code>index.contextLimit</code> by <code>insertion.length()</code>.
 Then the transliterator will try to transliterate characters of
 <code>text</code> between <code>index.start</code> and
 <code>index.contextLimit</code>.  Characters before
 <code>index.start</code> will not be changed.

 <p>Upon return, values in <code>index</code> will be updated.
 <code>index.contextStart</code> will be advanced to the first
 character that future calls to this method will read.
 <code>index.start</code> and <code>index.contextLimit</code> will
 be adjusted to delimit the range of text that future calls to
 this method may change.

 <p>Typical usage of this method begins with an initial call
 with <code>index.contextStart</code> and <code>index.contextLimit</code>
 set to indicate the portion of <code>text</code> to be
 transliterated, and <code>index.start == index.contextStart</code>.
 Thereafter, <code>index</code> can be used without
 modification in future calls, provided that all changes to
 <code>text</code> are made via this method.

 <p>This method assumes that future calls may be made that will
 insert new text into the buffer.  As a result, it only performs
 unambiguous transliterations.  After the last call to this
 method, there may be untransliterated text that is waiting for
 more input to resolve an ambiguity.  In order to perform these
 pending transliterations, clients should call <a href="../../../../com/ibm/icu/text/Transliterator.html#finishTransliteration-com.ibm.icu.text.Replaceable-com.ibm.icu.text.Transliterator.Position-"><code>finishTransliteration(com.ibm.icu.text.Replaceable, com.ibm.icu.text.Transliterator.Position)</code></a> after the last call to this

<div class="block">Abstract method that concrete subclasses define to implement
 their transliteration algorithm.  This method handles both
 incremental and non-incremental transliteration.  Let
 <code>originalStart</code> refer to the value of
 <code>pos.start</code> upon entry.

 <ul>
  <li>If <code>incremental</code> is false, then this method
  should transliterate all characters between
  <code>pos.start</code> and <code>pos.limit</code>. Upon return
  <code>pos.start</code> must == <code> pos.limit</code>.</li>

  <li>If <code>incremental</code> is true, then this method
  should transliterate all characters between
  <code>pos.start</code> and <code>pos.limit</code> that can be
  unambiguously transliterated, regardless of future insertions
  of text at <code>pos.limit</code>.  Upon return,
  <code>pos.start</code> should be in the range
  [<code>originalStart</code>, <code>pos.limit</code>).
  <code>pos.start</code> should be positioned such that
  characters [<code>originalStart</code>, <code>
  pos.start</code>) will not be changed in the future by this
  transliterator and characters [<code>pos.start</code>,
  <code>pos.limit</code>) are unchanged.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Implementations of this method should also obey the
 following invariants:</p>

 <ul>
  <li> <code>pos.limit</code> and <code>pos.contextLimit</code>
  should be updated to reflect changes in length of the text
  between <code>pos.start</code> and <code>pos.limit</code>. The
  difference <code> pos.contextLimit - pos.limit</code> should
  not change.</li>

  <li><code>pos.contextStart</code> should not change.</li>

  <li>Upon return, neither <code>pos.start</code> nor
  <code>pos.limit</code> should be less than
  <code>originalStart</code>.</li>

  <li>Text before <code>originalStart</code> and text after
  <code>pos.limit</code> should not change.</li>

  <li>Text before <code>pos.contextStart</code> and text after
  <code> pos.contextLimit</code> should be ignored.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Subclasses may safely assume that all characters in
 [<code>pos.start</code>, <code>pos.limit</code>) are filtered.
 In other words, the filter has already been applied by the time
 this method is called.  See
 <code>filteredTransliterate()</code>.

 <p>This method is <b>not</b> for public consumption.  Calling
 this method directly will transliterate
 [<code>pos.start</code>, <code>pos.limit</code>) without
 applying the filter. End user code should call <code>
 transliterate()</code> instead of this method. Subclass code
 should call <code>filteredTransliterate()</code> instead of
 this method.<p></div>

<div class="block">Returns the set of all characters that may be generated as

 <p>SHOULD BE OVERRIDEN BY SUBCLASSES.
 It is probably an error for any transliterator to NOT override this, but we can't force them to
 for backwards compatibility.
 <p>Other methods vector through this.
 <p>When gathering the information on source and target, the compound transliterator makes things complicated.
 For example, suppose we have:
 <pre>
 Global FILTER = [ax]
 a &gt; b;
 :: NULL;
 b &gt; c;
 x &gt; d;
 </pre>
 While the filter just allows a and x, b is an intermediate result, which could produce c. So the source and target sets
 cannot be gathered independently. What we have to do is filter the sources for the first transliterator according to
 the global filter, intersect that transliterator's filter. Based on that we get the target.
 The next transliterator gets as a global filter (global + last target). And so on.
 <p>There is another complication:
 <pre>
 Global FILTER = [ax]
 a &gt;|b;
 b &gt;c;
 </pre>
 Even though b would be filtered from the input, whenever we have a backup, it could be part of the input. So ideally we will
 change the global filter as we go.</div>
