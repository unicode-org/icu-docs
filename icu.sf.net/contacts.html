<h2>Mailing Lists and Contacts</h2>
<hr />
<p>ICU uses several mailing lists for discussions, announcements and
notifications. The mailing list server provides web-based subscription with
many options, list archives, digest mode, etc. Please follow the links to the
mailing lists you are interested in.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In order to send emails to the following lists you <em>need
to subscribe</em> to them. You can look at the list archives without
subscribing.</p>
<p>When you subscribe to the lists, please make sure that the email address
that you are subscribing matches <em>exactly</em> the address that your email
program is using. Otherwise, your emails will not go through to the list. The
mailing list server matches addresses strictly, including case and the domain
(server name) part of addresses.</p>
<p>As a general rule of etiquette, please do not include confidential
information or mark your e-mails as urgent. These are public mailing lists used
by many volunteers. The volunteers will try to answer your question as soon as
possible.</p>

<td>This list contains API proposals and general technical discussions (for
example: discussions about new APIs, feature improvements and general
discussions that affect ICU4C and ICU4J). If you have problem building ICU, do
not use this list. Please use the icu-support mailing list.</td>

<p>You can <b>report a bug or request a new feature</b> with the <a href=
"http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgibin/icu-bugs">jitterbug</a> system. (This is not a
mailing list, but a web-based bug tracking system). If you have an ICU4C or
ICU4J build problem, you will get a faster response from the icu-support
mailing list. Please do not use the icu-design mailing list for build
issues.</p>
