</p>
<p> Let's roll back the clock for a moment--all the way back to 1996. Java had 
  been out for little more than a year, and it was already supported in browsers 
  such as Netscape. The new language's popularity was beginning to snowball, and 
  most of the programmers I knew had already decided they wanted to learn it.</p>
<p>The Java language, tools, and library were much easier to use than most existing 
  C++ tools, and many programmers felt they could be more productive writing in 
  Java. In addition, Java was already "cool." Java applets ran on the Web, so 
  you could create Web pages with animation, embedded programs, and so on. </p>
<p>Enter IBM. IBM was early to recognize the importance of Java--way back in 1995. 
  At the time, "client/server" development was all the rage. Traditionally, big 
  hardware companies like IBM have made their money on servers: S/390s, AS/400s, 
  and so on. But that's only half the picture. All the mainframe databases in 
  the world aren't much use if you don't have a client that allows people to do 
  something meaningful with the data.</p>
<p>That's where Java comes in: Java is easy to learn, efficient to develop, and 
  portable--the perfect platform for writing clients that can run on multiple 
  platforms and access data from multiple sources. And if there are more and better 
  clients, there will be more servers, more software tools for creating them, 
  and more opportunities for service and consulting businesses.</p>
<p> <a name="h1"><span class="atitle2"><b>Ready for prime time?</b></span></a><br />
  But at the same time, a lot of people felt Java wasn't "real" yet. Sure, you 
  could use it to create cool little toys to embed in your Web pages, but that 
  seemed to be about all anyone was doing with it. Most people weren't writing 
  Java programs that did anything particularly useful yet, and for several reasons: 
</p>
<p>First, there was the time factor. Java hadn't been out for all that long, and 
  many developers still viewed it as an experiment--something to learn and to 
  play with, but not to do real work in yet. And second, Java was fairly slow. 
  This was in the days before JITs, so Java bytecode was always interpreted (rather 
  than compiled to machine language). Finally, the support needed by business 
  developers was still embryonic: database access, security, internationalization, 
  and so on.</p>
<p>Yes, <i>internationalization</i>. Throughout the '80s and '90s, business has 
  become more global. The explosive growth of the Internet over the last five 
  years has contributed to this trend, and many businesses now operate in multiple 
  countries and languages. The software used to run those businesses must also 
  be global, with support for the different locales in which companies operate. 
  Java, in its JDK 1.0 incarnation, had the beginnings of international support, 
  because a Java <code>char</code> is stored as a Unicode character. But that 
  was all. You couldn't enter or display non-Latin characters, and there were 
  no facilities for language-sensitive formatting, sorting, and so on.</p>
<p>Issues such as performance, database access, and security were being addressed 
  in other ways by Sun, IBM, JIT developers, database companies, and others. But 
  nobody was addressing the internationalization issue. Sun recognized there was 
  a problem, but didn't really have the resources to solve it on their own.</p>
<p> <a name="h2"><span class="atitle2"><b>Teaming up for international acceptance</b></span></a><br />
  Meanwhile, in early 1996, IBM had assumed full ownership of Taligent, the joint 
  venture started by IBM and Apple and later joined by HP. Taligent had been developing 
  an object-oriented application framework and operating system called CommonPoint, 
  which included extensive international support. When IBM took over, CommonPoint 
  was mothballed, but much of the underlying technology was integrated into other 
  IBM products.</p>
<p>Fairly quickly, the management of IBM and Taligent came to a realization: Java 
  was missing international support. But Taligent had great international technology, 
  talented engineers--including Dr. Mark Davis, president of the Unicode Consortium--and 
  a location about 100 meters from Sun's JavaSoft division in Cupertino, California. 
  Thus, a partnership was born: IBM arranged for Taligent's Text and International 
  group to contribute international classes to Sun's Java Development Kit, making 
  Java powerful enough for real-world business applications.</p>
<p>For JDK 1.1, Taligent provided the new <code>java.text</code> package, plus 
  a number of new classes in <code>java.util</code>. This included <code>Format</code> 
  and all its subclasses for formatting dates, times, numbers and messages; <code>Collator</code>, 
  for language-sensitive string sorting; and <code>BreakIterator</code> , for 
  determining line, word, and sentence boundaries in Unicode text. In <code>java.util</code>, 
  Taligent contributed parts of <code>ResourceBundle</code>, as well as the <code>Calendar</code> 
  and <code>TimeZone</code> classes (which provide flexible, international-friendly 
  date and time support). In addition, IBM contributed a large collection of locale 
  data from their National Language Technical Center in Toronto. This API and 
  data provide a standard way to handle the requirements of different countries 
  and languages, making this transparent to developers.</p>
<p>While reimplementing the international classes in Java, the developers took 
  advantage of the opportunity to redesign the frameworks for easier use. The 
  design of the Java language itself allowed for a simpler application program 
  interface (API) and implementation. (The effort was led by Mark Davis, Taligent's 
  international architect, with participants from both Taligent and JavaSoft.) 
  The initial phase of this work was completed in early 1997 and released in JDK 
  1.1. Taligent continued to maintain the code, contributing several bug fixes 
  to releases up through JDK 1.1.4.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of 1997, when IBM absorbed Taligent and its employees 
  completely. The Text and International group survived the transition intact, 
  becoming the Unicode Technology Group at the new IBM Center for Java Technology 
  in Cupertino. We're at the other end of the parking lot from Taligent's old 
  building--and still just down the street from Sun. We continued to work closely 
  with Sun to maintain and enhance the international features in the JDK, contributing 
  more bug fixes in JDK 1.1.6.</p>
<p>At the same time, IBM worked closely with Sun to design and implement enhancements 
  for Java 2, under development throughout 1998. The Unicode Technology group 
  was no exception: We added several APIs and features to Java 2, including support 
  for bidirectional Hebrew and Arabic text. We also extended the classes we'd 
  contributed for 1.1, adding enhancements such as <code>Collator</code> search 
  support, better <code>TimeZone</code> support, and an improved <code>DecimalFormat</code> 
  .</p>
<p> <a name="h3"><span class="atitle2"><b>More work ahead</b></span></a><br />
  But Java 2 wasn't the end of our work on internationalization in Java: We're 
  still working closely with Sun's international team: We now have an IBM engineer 
  on site at Sun full-time, and others work remotely, occasionally visiting the 
  Sun site. We've continued to fix bugs in the JDK--both in JDK 1.2.2 and 1.3--and 
  we're involved in Sun design processes. We're also working on new features for 
  possible inclusion in future JDKs, releasing preliminary versions of some of 
  these technologies on the IBM alphaWorks Web site.</p>
<p>Finally, we're working on a few new features for IBM's own versions of the 
  JDK. Since IBM and Sun sometimes have different priorities, there are international 
  features that IBM feels are important but that aren't as high on Sun's list. 
  In the past, IBM has usually waited until we could persuade Sun to add each 
  new feature into their reference release of Java, but there are now a few features 
  we've decided simply can't wait.</p>
<p>On the international front, these new features include support for Hindi and 
  Thai, full bidirectional-orientation support in Swing, and a few new locales 
  and code pages. Though this work will appear first in an IBM JDK, we're still 
  working closely with Sun to ensure that what we do remains compatible with the 
  enhancements Sun is making in 1.3 and beyond. In fact, the Swing-orientation 
  work is being done jointly by Sun and IBM engineers; it will appear in Sun's 
  JDK 1.3 at around the same time it surfaces in an IBM release.</p>
