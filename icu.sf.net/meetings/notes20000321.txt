- ICU 1.4.1 Release is now available!! This release contains updated
copyright notices important for product integration.

- Proposal Voting and Discussion:
    * XML Mapping tables: The tables were generated by calling Microsoft
Windows API on a NT 4.0 machine. The tool will be extended to run on
other Windows environment in the future.  The tables are converted to
XML format with character charts in HTML format.  This data repository
will be posted on the ICU OSS server shortly.
    * Conversion fallback handling: We all agreed that the two API
additions are necessary.  The APIs will be changed to setUsingFallback()
and isUsingFallback().  Updating the javadoc to describe the usage of
the ucnv_open() API is required.
    * Converter names: Yves will send out an updated proposal to the
'icu' mailing list about this.
- Additional agenda items:
    * PMC member list update:  Helena proposed to purge the committee to
include the more active participants.  David Craig mentioned that he is
not ready to commit to the responsibilities yet.    Current PMC member
and their alternates are:
    Mark Davis
