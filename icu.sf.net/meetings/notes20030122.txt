Locale Repository Update

    Helena:
        - Currently it is stuck in the approval process
        - The approval is important for public review announcement and interfacing with W3C

    Tex:
        - The announcement should have generated a lot of interest... but nothing really materialized

    Helena:
        - ICU mailing lists are sealed away from Locale Repository

    Tex:
        - There is a discussion going on in Web Services Task force
        - Pushing the locale repository as one of the possible solutions
 
How 2.4 was received

    George: 
        - Very well recieved
        - Most questions on configuration issues
    Tex:
        - Since most questions are on configuration issues, these must be from new users who are starting to use ICU.
          It is fairly early to think everything is fine since most users may not have started using ICU 2.4.
    Tex:
        - Not very involved in ICU 
        - Looking into using ICU in some projects
    Helena:
        - How is the customer feedback that Tex may have recieved from outside
    Tex:
        - Brings up ICU as a solution
        - Not too many questions about details of ICU
        - ICU has a good reputation and is percieved as a solution.

        - How much technical work would it take
