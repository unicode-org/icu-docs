Allocate a <code>UBiDi</code> structure with preallocated memory
for internal structures.
This function provides a <code>UBiDi</code> object like <code>ubidi_open()</code>
with no arguments, but it also preallocates memory for internal structures
according to the sizings supplied by the caller.<p>
Subsequent functions will not allocate any more memory, and are thus
guaranteed not to fail because of lack of memory.<p>
The preallocation can be limited to some of the internal memory
by setting some values to 0 here. That means that if, e.g.,
<code>maxRunCount</code> cannot be reasonably predetermined and should not
be set to <code>maxLength</code> (the only failproof value) to avoid
wasting memory, then <code>maxRunCount</code> could be set to 0 here
and the internal structures that are associated with it will be allocated
on demand, just like with <code>ubidi_open()</code>.

<DL><DT><B>Returns:</B><DD>An empty <code>UBiDi</code> object with preallocated memory.
<DT><B>Parameters:</B><DD><B>maxLength</B> -  is the maximum paragraph or line length that internal memory
will be preallocated for. An attempt to associate this object with a
longer text will fail, unless this value is 0, which leaves the allocation
up to the implementation.
<br><B>maxRunCount</B> -  is the maximum anticipated number of same-level runs
that internal memory will be preallocated for. An attempt to access
visual runs on an object that was not preallocated for as many runs
as the text was actually resolved to will fail,
unless this value is 0, which leaves the allocation up to the implementation.<p>
The number of runs depends on the actual text and maybe anywhere between
1 and <code>maxLength</code>. It is typically small.<p>
<br><B>pErrorCode</B> -  must be a valid pointer to an error code value,
which must not indicate a failure before the function call.
