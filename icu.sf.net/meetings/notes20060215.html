<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h4> Schedule for Maintenance Releases ICU4J 3.4.3, ICU4C 3.4.1</h4>

These releases will contain time zone changes &amp; bug fixes.
&nbsp;Hope to release before IUC, in the next few weeks.<br>

<h4>UText Iteration Boundary or Limits proposal</h4>

Support for limiting a case mapping to a substring like range of text. <br>

Add a setter and getter to UText for start &amp; end of iteration
ranges.<br>

Andy will make an API proposal.<br>

<br>

<h4> UText getIndex / setIndex, or Mark / return to position</h4>

Deborah is concerned about the speed of getIndex or getOffset, <br>

and the ability to mark and return to a position efficiently.<br>

Concern with function call overhead on getNativeIndex() in the pure
UTF-16 case<br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Markus</span>: A
less safe setNativeIndex() could also speed things up<br>

by bypassing the code point boundary test. ResetNativeIndex()<br>

<br>

Markus suggests a getPosition that returns/sets some sort of<br>

struct that optimizes returning to a postion.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Deborah</span>:
MoveIndex32 could be more efficient, even without<br>

being a macro. It's making too many function calls.<br>

Markus notes that this is an implementation detail, no API
consideration.<br>

<br>

Markus suggests an optimization for MoveIndex32,<br>

if the provider could signal that there are no supplementary chars
possible,<br>

a bunch of checks could be eliminated.<br>

<br>

Andy to send Deborah a note with comments on the MoveIndex32
optimization suggestions.<br>

<br>

<h4> UCaseMap adopt/release of the embedded break iterator. </h4>

Decision: Setter adopts the break iterator, getter returns a live const
pointer<br>

to the embedded BI. No cloning of the break iterator.<br>

<br>

<br>

<h4> Tools Questions: the future of ICUSwap, gencmn, decmn</h4>

Should the old tools be removed immediately, or should there be a grace
period?<br>

Should all ICUSwap functionality be embedded into icupkg?<br>

Should old tools be emulated by a script that invokes icupgk?<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Deborah</span>:
keeping old tools alive creates a maintenance issue.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Steven</span>:
wants ability to swap individual res files (for use with ICU4J)<br>

decisions:<br>

Markus will assess adding ICUswap functionality to icupgk, do it now if
easy.<br>

icuswap, gencmn, decmn will be maintained in ICU (built, installed)<br>

for a grace period of one release.<br>

Each obsolete tool will produce warnings on use.<br>

<br>

<h4> Thai Dictionary Integration (Deborah)</h4>

Deborah will work with Steven in integrating the Thai dictionary
builder tool into ICU.<br>

Deborah will provide documentation of the dictionary binary format<br>

comparable in detail to descriptions for other ICU binary formats<br>
