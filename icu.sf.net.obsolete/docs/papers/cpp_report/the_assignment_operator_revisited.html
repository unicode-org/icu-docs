<p>If you think you know it all in the C++ world, it must mean you&#146;re not talking to
your colleagues very much. If I had any pretensions to knowing it all when I wrote my
assignment-operator article (&quot;<a href="the_anatomy_of_the_assignment_operator.html">The Anatomy of the Assignment
Operator</a>,&quot; <i>C++ Report,</i> Nov/Dec 1997), they didn&#146;t last long
afterwards.</p>

<p>The assignment-operator article drew a huge response, with a lot of people sending me
corrections and disagreements of various kinds. The issues have been mounting up, so I
thought maybe a follow-on article to discuss the issues would be appropriate.</p>

<h3>The big mistake</h3>

<p>One I heard about almost instantly from several people (and which I&#146;m really glad
I heard about before delivering a talk on this subject at C++ World) was a rather serious
mistake. When I first did this article, I had the big &quot;right answer&quot; like this:</p>

<pre>TFoo&amp;
TFoo::operator=(const TFoo&amp; that)
{
    if (this != &amp;that) {
        TSuperFoo::operator=(that);
        TBar* bar1 = 0;
        TBar* bar2 = 0;

        try {
            bar1 = new TBar(*that.fBar1);
            bar2 = new TBar(*that.fBar2);
        }
        catch (...) {
            delete bar1;
            delete bar2;
            throw;
        }

        delete fBar1;
        fBar1 = bar1;
        delete fBar2;
        fBar2 = bar2;
    }
    return *this;
}</pre>

<p>This was wrong, and it was caught in the review process. The problem here is that if
you&#146;re trying to transactionize the assignment, so that either all of it happens or
none of it happens, this breaks that. If an exception occurs trying to new up <tt>bar1</tt>
or <tt>bar2</tt>, the <tt>TFoo</tt> part of the object won&#146;t have changed, but the <tt>TSuperFoo</tt>
part will have. The call to <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> can&#146;t go at the top of
the function.</p>

<p>As I said, this was caught during the review process. So when the article ran, this
example looked like this:</p>

<pre>TFoo&amp;
TFoo::operator=(const TFoo&amp; that)
{
    if (this != &amp;that) {
        TBar* bar1 = 0;
        TBar* bar2 = 0;

        try {
            bar1 = new TBar(*that.fBar1);
            bar2 = new TBar(*that.fBar2);
        }
        catch (...) {
            delete bar1;
            delete bar2;
            throw;
        }

        TSuperFoo::operator=(that);
        delete fBar1;
        fBar1 = bar1;
        delete fBar2;
        fBar2 = bar2;
    }
    return *this;
}</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that&#146;s wrong too. The problem is we&#146;re still hosed if <tt>TSuperFoo</tt>&#146;s
assignment operator can also throw an exception, which is a reasonable thing to expect. If
we succeed in creating our <tt>TBar</tt> objects, but <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt>
fails to create whatever he needs to (presumably he&#146;s also transactionized), the
object will correctly be left untouched, but we&#146;ll leak the new <tt>TBars</tt> we
created. So the <i>right</i>&nbsp;answer (he said sheepishly) is this:</p>

<pre>TFoo&amp;
TFoo::operator=(const TFoo&amp; that)
{
    if (this != &amp;that) {
        TBar* bar1 = 0;
        TBar* bar2 = 0;

        try {
            bar1 = new TBar(*that.fBar1);
            bar2 = new TBar(*that.fBar2);
            TSuperFoo::operator=(that);
        }
        catch (...) {
            delete bar1;
            delete bar2;
            throw;
        }

        delete fBar1;
        fBar1 = bar1;
        delete fBar2;
        fBar2 = bar2;
    }
    return *this;
}</pre>

<p>The call to <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> has to go inside the try. Notice that it
goes <i>after</i> we create the new <tt>TBars</tt>. We want to make sure creating the <tt>TBar</tt>s
has succeeded before we call <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> because <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt>
might succeed, changing the object, and we only want to change the object if we can carry
out the whole assignment operation.</p>

<p>One interesting consequence of this is that you can imagine a class with a fairly deep
inheritance chain where every class up the chain has other objects it owns. You&#146;d
call an assignment operator low in the chain, it&#146;d create the objects it needs, then
it&#146;d call its parent, which would create the objects it needs and call <i>its</i>
parent, and so on up the chain. Eventually, all of the new objects would have been created
and would be pointed to by temporary variables on the stack. Then, at the root level, the
assignment would finally begin to be carried out, with objects being deleted and the
object&#146;s data members being changed as each function returned. So the allocations
happen in one order and the assignments and deletions happen in reverse order, which feels
kind of awkward at first glance, but it gets the job done. It also means that there has to
be enough free memory to hold two instances of every subobject, but there really
isn&#146;t a safe way around allocating all the extra memory.</p>

<p>By the way, I&#146;ve also had several people question my assumption that the delete
operations won&#146;t throw exceptions. Technically they&#146;re right, but I&#146;d
strongly counsel against letting this happen. I think it&#146;s wise to declare
&quot;Destructors will not throw exceptions, nor will they allow exceptions thrown by
functions they call to propagate out of them&quot; to be a program invariant. The reason
for this is that destructors are called in the course of <i>handling</i> exceptions. If
exception-handling code can throw more exceptions, it&#146;s extremely difficult, if not
downright impossible, for everyone to properly clean up after himself, and extremely
difficult for the program to completely recover from the error condition and go on.
Therefore, throwing or propagating exceptions from within destructors is not a good idea.</p>

<h3>The magic three</h3>

<p>In my previous article, I singled out C++&#146;s &quot;magic three&quot; functions, the
default constructor, copy constructor and default assignment operator and said that one
should always define them. This has raised a few hackles.</p>

<p>First, several people correctly pointed out that the default constructor is only
defined by the compiler when you don&#146;t create <i>any other</i> constructors. This is
indeed true; I left this fact out for simplicity. In retrospect, I shouldn&#146;t have.</p>

<p>Several people took exception to my statement that every class should define the
&quot;magic three.&quot; They were disturbed by the suggestion that every object should
have a default constructor. They&#146;re right. There are probably more objects for which
it isn&#146;t appropriate to have a default constructor than there are for which it is.
Oftentimes, you can&#146;t initialize an object to a meaningful state without some data
being supplied from outside, or you can only do it by adding special-case code just to
support a default constructor you don&#146;t really need.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you even have a default constructor forced on you. Taligent&#146;s
CommonPoint system did this: its serialization facilities required a default consructor to
work right, one of the bigger architectural gaffes in that system, in my opinion (of
course, now I&#146;ll get angry letters from ex-Taligent people explaining why it had to
be that way).</p>

<p>I think what I really meant to say in the original article didn&#146;t come through
strong enough: You should always <i>declare</i> the magic three functions. This way, you
make an explicit statement that you are not accepting the default implementations of these
functions. If a default constructor isn&#146;t appropriate for your class, don&#146;t
write one just for the sake of writing one; declare it private and give it an empty
implementation. But be sure you declare it. Same goes for the copy constructor and
assignment operator.</p>

<p>A number of people also suggested an improvement to my original advice: &quot;If you
don&#146;t want it, declare it private and give it an empty implementation.&quot; You
actually don&#146;t have to give an unwanted function an implementation at all. You can
declare the function private and not define it. The declaration will suppress the
compiler-generated version of the function, but not defining it saves you from having to
supply dummy code that doesn&#146;t actually do anything and will never get called.
Furthermore, while declaring the function private will prevent outside classes from
calling it, it won&#146;t prevent <i>the same class</i> from calling it. If you don&#146;t
supply an implementation, the class will get a link error if it calls its own unwanted
magic functions. This is somewhat nonintuitive to debug, but it&#146;s better than having
the compiler silently let the caller get away with calling a function nobody&#146;s
supposed to call.</p>

<p>I also had people take rather violent exception to my suggestion that one should always
define the copy constructor and assignment operator, even when they really do what you
want them to do. They pointed out that it&#146;s a lot of wasted boilerplate code, which
is ugly and a pain to maintain. Furthermore, it&#146;s possible for the compiler to
perform optimizations on the default functions that it might not be able (or willing) to
perform on user-written code. Most importantly, if you add or delete members from the
class, the default copy constructor and assignment operator pick up the changes
automatically. If you define these functions yourself, you have to remember to maintain
them when the class definition changes, or you&#146;ll have compiler errors or runtime
bugs.</p>

<p>This is all very true, but I&#146;ll stand by my original advice just the same.
Boilerplate copy constructors and assignment operators are ugly code and a hassle to
maintain, but being in the habit of always writing the copy constructor and assignment
operator also puts you in the habit of thinking about just what the correct copy behavior
is for all the members of your class. If all the members are integers, this probably
isn&#146;t a big deal, but if they&#146;re pointers, it&#146;s a very big deal. Getting
into the habit of accepting the defaults without taking the time to think about it can
also lead to bugs down the road if you mistakenly accept the default when it <i>doesn&#146;t</i>
do the right thing.</p>

<p>And, of course, you have to rely on comments to explain that you know about the default
and are failing to define these functions <i>on purpose.</i> I&#146;m always a little
uncomfortable with relying on documentation for things like that.</p>

<h3>Virtual assignment</h3>

<p>Finally, several people, including my own manager here at IBM, disputed my advice to
make the assignment operator of a class non-virtual. Let&#146;s take a closer look at this
issue.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple example:</p>

<pre>X* x;

void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    x = &amp;newX;
}</pre>

<p>This will work right, but only if <tt>X</tt> is a monomorphic class. But let&#146;s say
<tt>X</tt> is polymorphic. Pretend it has an inheritance hierarchy like this:</p>

<pre>  X
 / \
Y   Z</pre>

<p>That is&#133;</p>

<pre>class X {
    // ...
}

class Y : public X {
   // ...
}

class Z : public X {
    // ...
}</pre>

<p>Now, if either <tt>x</tt> or <tt>newX</tt> points to an object of class <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt>,
we&#146;ll slice. Only the members defined in <tt>X</tt> will get copied. If <tt>x</tt> is
an instance of <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt>, the members defined by <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt>
won&#146;t get led in with new values. If <tt>newX</tt> is an instance of <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt>,
the members defined by <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt> won&#146;t get copied into <tt>x</tt>. Bad
news.</p>

<p>The problem here, of course, is that we&#146;re calling <tt>X</tt>&#146;s assignment
operator even when <tt>x</tt> isn&#146;t an instance of <tt>X</tt>. The obvious solution,
therefore, would be to make <tt>X</tt>&#146;s assignment operator virtual. Then the
correct assignment operator would be called. If we do this, the assignment operators would
look like this:</p>

<pre>X&amp; X::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    // copy X&#146;s members...
    return *this;
}

X&amp; Y::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    Y&amp; y = dynamic_cast&lt;Y&amp;&gt;(that);

    X::operator=(that);
    // copy Y&#146;s members using y
    return *this;
}

X&amp; Z::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    Z&amp; z = dynamic_cast&lt;Z&amp;&gt;(that);

    X::operator=(that);
    // copy Z&#146;s members using z
    return *this;
}</pre>

<p>Now, if <tt>x</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> are actually both instances of <tt>Y</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>&#146;s
assignment operator will get called and everybody will work right. Big improvement, right?</p>

<p>Well, consider the situation where <tt>x</tt> is a <tt>Y</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> is a <tt>Z</tt>.
In this case, the <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> will fail, throwing a <tt>bad_cast</tt> exception.
Now we have a problem.</p>

<p>The <tt>bad_cast</tt> exception is good, in a way, because it traps the mismatched
classes and causes an error, rather than just slicing silently. But now we have an error
condition we have to handle.</p>

<p>Remember that after an assignment succeeds, the objects on either side of the <tt>=</tt>
are to be computationally equivalent. That is, all of their visible state and their
behavior should be the same. This implies that they should be the same class. What you
really want is for it to look like <tt>x</tt> morphed from whatever class it was to the
same class <tt>newX</tt> is. <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt>&#146;s assignment
operators can&#146;t do this; there&#146;s no way to morph an existing object from one
class to another (well, there kind of is, but we&#146;ll get to it later). Instead, <tt>setX()</tt>
has to deal with this:</p>

<pre>void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    try {
        x = &amp;newX;
    }
    catch (bad_cast&amp;) {
        X* temp = newX.clone();
        delete x;
        x = temp;
    }
}</pre>

<p>Remember <tt>clone()</tt>? This is the polymorphic copy constructor. If you need
polymorphic copy on a group of related classes, you define a virtual function called <tt>clone()</tt>
and every class in the tree overrides it to call his own copy constructor. You can&#146;t
just call <tt>X</tt>&#146;s copy constructor for the same reason you can&#146;t just call <tt>X</tt>&#146;s
assignment operator.</p>

<p>Another alternative is that <tt>setX()</tt> doesn&#146;t handle this condition, but
some other class up the inheritance chain will have to, probably by doing the same thing
we&#146;re doing here: deleting the old <tt>X</tt> and creating a new one of the right
class. (There might be other meaningful ways of handling the exception, but they&#146;d be
more application-specific.)</p>

<p>The other possibility is that <i>nobody</i> handles the exception. We could just
declare &quot;assignment operators shall always be called with like classes on either side
of the equal sign&quot; as a program invariant. In other words, we declare heterogeneous
assignment to be a condition which Should Never Happen.</p>

<p>Violations of program invariants (&quot;Should Never Happen&quot; conditions) are
programmer errors; they&#146;re things you&#146;re assuming you&#146;ll never run into at
runtime. An exception shouldn&#146;t be thrown for a violated invariant; since you&#146;re
not expecting it to happen at runtime, you don&#146;t want to waste time putting in lots
of extra code to handle it; the program is just malformed. And if you throw an exception
that nobody catches, this simply causes your program to terminate. Quietly. With no error
messages.</p>

<p>If your program&#146;s going to terminate, you want it to terminate loudly, proclaiming
to the world that Something Went Wrong. The way you do this is with the <tt>assert()</tt>
macro. You pass to <tt>assert()</tt> an expression you expect to always evaluate to <tt>true</tt>.
If it evaluates to <tt>false</tt>, it prints an error message that usually contains the
text of the offending expression and the line number of the assert, and then the program
terminates. (You can also cause asserts to be compiled out in production versions of your
program, which will cause them to fail silently instead.)</p>

<p>So then instead of the dynamic cast, you can do a static cast and precede it with an
assert:</p>

<pre>X&amp; Y::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    assert(typeid(that) == typeid(*this));

    Y&amp; y = static_cast&lt;Y&amp;&gt;(that);
    X::operator=(that);
    // copy Y&#146;s members using y
    return *this;
}</pre>

<p>By the way, my original attempt at this was</p>

<pre>assert(typeid(that) == typeid(Y));</pre>

<p>You don&#146;t want to do it this way, because then when <tt>Y::operator=()</tt> calls <tt>X::operator=()</tt>,
<tt>X::operator=()</tt> will choke because <tt>that</tt> isn&#146;t an instance of <tt>X</tt>.
You&#146;re not concerned that &quot;that&quot; is some particular static type;
you&#146;re concerned that &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; are the <i>same</i> type,
whatever that type is.</p>

<p>So anyway, using the assert is one way around the heterogeneous-assignment problem, and
it has a lot to recommend it, in situations where you really know that this invariant can
hold.</p>

<p>But let&#146;s go back to the previous answer for a minute and assume we&#146;re going
to catch the exception and finagle the assignment in <tt>setX()</tt>. To refresh our
memory, <tt>setX()</tt> now looks like this:</p>

<pre>void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    try {
        x = &amp;newX;
    }
    catch (bad_cast&amp;) {
        X* temp = newX.clone();
        delete x;
        x = temp;
    }
}</pre>

<p>Let&#146;s consider our possibilities here, ignoring <tt>Z</tt> for a moment. If <tt>x</tt>
and <tt>newX</tt> are both instances of <tt>X</tt> or both instances of <tt>Y</tt>,
we&#146;re cool. If <tt>x</tt> is an instance of <tt>Y</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> is an
instance of <tt>X</tt>, we&#146;re also cool. <tt>Y::operator=()</tt> with throw a <tt>bad_cast</tt>
exception, and we&#146;ll catch it, delete <tt>x</tt>, and new up a fresh new <tt>Y</tt>
to assign to <tt>x</tt>.</p>

<p>But what if <tt>x</tt> is an instance of <tt>X</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> is an instance of
<tt>Y</tt>? In this case, we&#146;ll end up in <tt>X</tt>&#146;s assignment operator, and
the dynamic cast will <i>succeed.</i> <tt>Y</tt> is a subclass of <tt>X</tt>, so
dynamically casting a reference to a <tt>Y</tt> to a reference to an <tt>X</tt> is legal.
Every <tt>Y</tt> is also an <tt>X</tt>. But because we&#146;re in X&#146;s assignment
operator, we&#146;ll only copy over the members of <tt>newX</tt> that were defined in <tt>X</tt>.
It&#146;s our old friend slicing again.</p>

<p>What we&#146;d have to do to avoid this is manually check for like class in each
assignment operator and throw the <tt>bad_cast</tt> ourselves, rather than relying on <tt>dynamic_cast</tt>
to do it for us.</p>

<p>Instead, my original solution to this problem was to avoid using the assignment
operator in the first place:</p>

<pre>void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    X* temp = newX.clone();
    delete x;
    x = temp;
}</pre>

<p>I still like this. It&#146;s simple and clear, and it works correctly with no extra
hassles even when <tt>x</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> are instances of different classes. The
other solution, with the try/catch blocks, has an advantage in situations where the cost
of deleting and newing the destination object is large and relatively rare (the try costs
nothing in most modern compilers, so you in effect fast-path the case of like classes, but
an actual throw can be quite expensive, so you achieve this fast-path effect at the
expense of the different-classes case).</p>

<p>If the fast-path option makes sense for your application, I&#146;d suggest avoiding the
exception and doing it yourself like this:</p>

<pre>void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    if (typeid(*x) == typeid(newX))
        x = newX;
    else {
        X* temp = newX.clone();
        delete x;
        x = temp;
    }
}</pre>

<p>Now if you avoid using the assignment operator in situations where slicing may be a
problem, we&#146;re still left with the question of whether it makes more sense to make
the assignment operator virtual or non-virtual. I&#146;m tending now to come down on the
side of making the assignment operator virtual with an assert to check for the
different-classes condition (since there&#146;s no way to handle that in the assignment
operator itself and therefore the calling function already has to be aware of the
possibility of polymorphism and handle it).</p>

<p>However, there&#146;s another problem here. I remembered Taligent&#146;s coding
guidelines discouraging virtual assignment operators, so I went back to see why it
recommended that. I wish I had done that before. It turns out Taligent&#146;s guidelines
weren&#146;t hard and fast on the subject. Instead they point out that defining</p>

<pre>virtual X&amp; Y::operator=(const X&amp; that);</pre>

<p>won&#146;t keep the compiler from defining</p>

<pre>Y&amp; Y::operator=(const Y&amp; that);</pre>

<p>In other words, an override of an inherited assignment operator doesn&#146;t suppress
the compiler-generated default assignment operator. You&#146;d still have to do that
manually by declaring it private and not giving it an implementation.</p>

<p>And actually, this won&#146;t even work because C++&#146;s overload resolution rules
will cause the suppressed version to win in some types of call. For instance, consider a
class like this:</p>

<pre>class Y : public X {
    public:
        virtual X&amp; operator=(const X&amp; that);
        // other method definitions&#133;
    private:
        Y&amp; operator=(const Y&amp; that);
}</pre>

<p>Now consider this code snippet:</p>

<pre>Y someY(/*agruments*/);
// do something with someY
Y someOtherY(/*arguments*/);
someY = someOtherY;</pre>

<p>Since both <tt>someY</tt> and <tt>someOtherY</tt> are instances of <tt>Y</tt>, the
overload resolution rules will declare the nonvirtual version of <tt>operator=()</tt> to
be the &quot;winner,&quot; instead of the inherited virtual <tt>operator=()</tt>. Since
the nonvirtual <tt>operator=()</tt> is private, you&#146;ll get an access-violation error
at compile time.</p>

<p>Instead, you&#146;d have to define the default assignment operator to call the virtual
one. In every class that inherits the virtual one. Of course, this means defining it
non-virtual. To see why, imagine if <tt>Y</tt> in the above example had a subclass called <tt>Z</tt>.
If <tt>Y</tt>&#146;s <tt>operator=()</tt> was virtual, <tt>Z</tt> would have to override
it, then it would have to override <tt>X</tt>&#146;s <tt>operator=()</tt>, and then it
would have to replace its own default assignment operator. Cutting any corners here risks
creating situations where the &quot;winning&quot; function, according to the
overload-resolution rules, is a function that is not accessible or isn&#146;t implemented.
Clearly, this gets ridiculous quickly as the inheritance hierarchy gets deeper.</p>

<p>One side effect in either case is that you have to define an override of the virtual <tt>operator=()</tt>
even when you don&#146;t strictly need one; otherwise, the &quot;default&quot; one will
hide the virtual one.</p>

<p>So there you go. A truly foolproof method of handling polymorphism in assignment
operators involves declaring <i>both</i> a virtual <i>and</i> a non-virtual assignment
operator in every class (except the root class of each inheritance hierarchy), with the
non-virtual calling the virtual and the virtual asserting that both objects involved are
the same class. Any time a calling function couldn&#146;t guarantee the invariant would
hold, it would have to avoid using the assignment operator and manually delete the object
referenced by the target variable and new up a new one of the proper type.</p>

<p>Beautiful, huh?</p>

<h3>Other ways of morphing</h3>

<p>Before I wrap this up, one more thing: I alluded earlier to the idea that there are
ways of making an object look like it&#146;s morphed from one class to another. There are
two ways to do this, neither of which is really all that much of a winner.</p>

<p>One option is <i>not</i> to change the class of the object on the left-hand side.
It&#146;s perfectly reasonable to define assignment operators that take different types on
the left and right-hand side. The operator in this case performs some kind of meaningful
conversion of the incoming data as part of the assignment process. The result isn&#146;t
really a copy, but it may produce completely appropriate results. This solution is
definitely the right way to go for some classes in some applications, but it&#146;s not a
general solution. Be sure to consider whether it&#146;s appropriate for your classes
before going to all the trouble above.</p>

<p>The other option is to fake inheritance using containment. In this case, the objects on
the left and right-hand sides of the equal sign <i>are</i> the same class, but they behave
like members of different classes because they own objects of different classes. The
simplest version of this idea is a smart pointer that knows about polymorphism for a
certain group of classes and does the right thing. All you&#146;re really doing here is
encapsulating in this object&#146;s assignment operator the delete/new code you&#146;d
otherwise have to put in client code, but hiding junk like this in a smart-pointer class
is very often a useful and effective way to go. (This is the essence of the State pattern,
by the way.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I don&#146;t know about you, but there&#146;s something really scary to me about a
language where copying state from one object to another is this complicated. By now, I
suspect at least a dozen or two programmers have contributed something new to this
discussion. If it takes this many programmers to write a simple assignment operator, think
how complicated writing code that actually does something meaningful must be!</p>

<p>The devil truly is in the details, especially in C++ programming.</p>

<p>I&#146;m sure there are still other issues, both with the original article and this
one, that I&#146;ve missed. I&#146;ve learned a lot about this, and I&#146;m interested in
continuing to lean. Keep those cards and letters coming!</p>
