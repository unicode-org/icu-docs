<h1>Further Collation Items</h1>
<p>Mark Davis, 2005-01-24</p>
<h2>A. Other changes for Thai, Lao</h2>
<p>The following were missed when adjustments were made for Thai/Lao. So delete the following 
sections:</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4><strike>3.1.3 Rearrangement</strike></h4>
  <p><strike>Certain characters are not coded in logical order, such as the Thai vowels &#3648; through &#3652; 
  and the Lao vowels &#3776; through &#3780; (this list is indicated by the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/PropList.html">Logical_Order_Exception</a> 
  property). For collation, they are rearranged by swapping with the following character before 
  further processing, since logically they belong afterwards. For example, here is a string 
  processed by rearrangement:</strike></p>
  <table class="wide">
    <tr>
      <td width="15%"><strike>input string:</strike></td>
      <td><strike><tt>0E01 <b>0E40</b> 0E02 0E03</tt></strike></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strike>normalized string:</strike></td>
      <td><strike><tt>0E01 0E02 <b>0E40</b> 0E03</tt></strike></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>in <i>8 Searching and Matching (Informative)</i></p>
<ol start="6">
  <li><strike>Certain Thai and Lao vowels are swapped with the preceding character. For example, the 
  text string “&#3648;&#3586;” (...\u0E40\u0E02...) is modified internally in collation to “&#3586;&#3648;” 
  (...\u0E02\u0E40...). This may mean that a string logically matches a discontiguous section of 
  another string. If, however, the vowels are considered to be part of a grapheme cluster, then this 
  situation is handled by the <font size="3">&quot;whole grapheme clusters only&quot; option.</font></strike></li>
</ol>
<h2>B. Matching Type Interactions.</h2>
<p>The interactions of other conditions with the matching types (minimal, maximal, medial) needs to 
be clarified. Consider the following.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Pattern:</th>
    <td>abc</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Strength:</th>
    <td>primary</td>
    <td>thus ignoring combining marks, punctuation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Text:</th>
    <td>abc<font SIZE="3">¸-°d</font></td>
    <td>two combining marks, cedilla and ring</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Matches:</th>
    <td>|abc|<font SIZE="3">¸|-|°|d</font></td>
    <td>four possible endpoints, indicated by |</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When an additional condition is set on the match, the types (minimal, maximal, medial) are based 
on the matches <i>that meet that condition.</i> Thus if the condition is Whole Grapheme, then the 
matches are restricted to &quot;abc<font SIZE="3">¸|-°|d&quot;, thus discarding match positions that would not 
be on a grapheme cluster boundary. Thus the minimal </font>match would be &quot;abc<font SIZE="3">¸|-°d&quot;</font></p>
<p>The changes to the text would include explaining the above situation in the introductory text in 
that section, and changing <b>DS5</b> and moving it. Suggestion the following:</p>
<p><i>Delete current DS5.</i></p>
<p><i>Add</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>DS1a. </b>A boundary condition is a test imposed on an offset within a string. Examples 
  include <font size="3">Whole Grapheme Cluster Search and Whole Word Search, as defined in UAX #29.
  </font><span class="changedspan">See [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/tr10-12.html#Breaks">Breaks</a>]).</span></p>
  <p>By using grapheme-complete conditions, contractions and combining sequences are not 
  interrupted.<span class="changedspan"> This also avoids the need to present visually discontiguous 
  selections to the user (except for BIDI text).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="changedspan"><i>Revise the following:</i></span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose there is a collation C, a pattern string P and a target string Q. C has some particular 
  set of attributes, such as a strength setting, and choice of variable weighting.</p>
  <p><b>DS2. </b>There is a <i>match</i> according to C for P within Q[<i>s,e</i>] if and only if C 
  generates the same sort key for P as for Q[s,e].</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="changedspan"><i>to</i></span></p>
<blockquote>

  condition B. C has some particular set of attributes, such as a strength setting, and choice of

  <p>DS2b A match <font size="3">is</font> <i>grapheme-complete</i> if B requires that the offset be 
  at a grapheme cluster boundary. Note that Whole Word Search as defined in UAX #29 is grapheme 
  complete. <span class="changedspan">See [<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/tr10-12.html#Breaks">Breaks</a>]).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="changedspan">I think we should also add some more explanatory text about combining 
marks. Those can be a bit tricky!</span></p>
<h2>C. Matching and Searching claims</h2>
<p>We don't give a way for people to specifically claim conformance to matching and searching 
according to Section 8. Suggest (a) removing &quot;(informative)&quot; from the title, and (b) adding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><a name="C4">C</a></b><a name="C4"><b>5</b></a> <i>An implementation claiming conformance to 
  Matching and Searching according to UAX #10, shall meet the requirements described in Section 8.</i></p>
</blockquote>
