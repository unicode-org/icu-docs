Cooperation</font></p>

<p>In 1991, with great fanfare, IBM and Apple Computer announced the formation of a new
joint venture, Taligent. Taligent&#146;s mission was to develop the next great
personal-computer operating system. It was to utilize all of the latest techniques of
software design and development, which, among other things, meant it was to be fully
object-oriented. This, of course, meant it was to be developed in C++, the object-oriented
programming language of choice. Many of Apple and IBM&#146;s best and brightest
object-oriented programmers went to Taligent, and many in the industry (at least many
Apple-watchers) had high hopes.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of years, Taligent engineers worked furiously on the Taligent
operating system and its accompanying development tools, and Taligent played a significant
role in advancing the state of the art in C++ technology.</p>

<p>By 1995, it had become clear that the world didn&#146;t need another operating system,
Apple Computer pulled out of the joint venture, and Taligent has since been completely
absorbed into IBM. Taligent&#146;s former engineers are based in two IBM development labs,
and are still highly respected object-oriented developers. But one important thing has
changed: to a person, all of them are doing Java development&#151;even the die-hard C++
fanatics&#151;either full-time or part-time.</p>

<p>I offer this little anecdote by way of answering the question, &quot;Why are you
publishing a column about Java in a magazine about C++?&quot; The fact is, however you
feel about Java as a programming language, an operating environment, or a way of life, at
some point and in some way, as a C++ programmer, you&#146;ll have to deal with it. The
point of this column is not to sell you on Java or to convince you to switch programming
languages, but merely to try to dispel some of the myths and half-truths surrounding the
language and to call out the similarities and differences between it and C++. I hope to
illustrate both the ways in which Java is better and the ways in which C++ is better.</p>

<p>I&#146;m going to try to stick to technical issues rather than business or political
issues, and I should make it clear that although I work for IBM, in no way should anything
I say here be construed as speaking for anyone other than myself.</p>

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

<p>Java was designed to appeal to the C++ programmer. Its syntax was designed to look and
feel as much like C++ as possible, but at the same time, the language designers made a
real effort to simplify the language and, in the process, fix some of the things that many
programmers hate about C++ and to make it easier for novices to learn.</p>

<p>Let&#146;s take a superficial look at some of these similarities and differences.
Here&#146;s a simple C++ function that performs a bubble sort on an array of integers: </p>

<pre>void bubbleSort(int[] array, int length) {
    bool didSwap = true;
    int ceiling = length &#150; 1;

    while (didSwap &amp;&amp; ceiling &gt; 0) {
        didSwap = false;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ceiling; i++)
            if (array[i] &gt; array[i + 1]) {
                int temp = array[i];
                array[i] = array[i + 1];
                array[i + 1] = temp;
                didSwap = true;
            }
        --ceiling;
    }
}</pre>

<p>In Java, this code looks virtually identical: </p>

<pre>public void bubbleSort(int[] array) {
    boolean didSwap = true;
    int ceiling = array.length &#150; 1;
    while (didSwap &amp;&amp; ceiling &gt; 0) {
        didSwap = false;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ceiling; i++)
            if (array[i] &gt; array[i + 1]) {
                int temp = array[i];
                array[i] = array[i + 1];
                array[i + 1] = temp;
                didSwap = true;
            }
        --ceiling;
    }
}</pre>

<p>This is the kind of thing the designers of Java were going for&#151;code that looks and
feels as much like C or C++ as possible without inheriting its faults. All of the same
control structures and operators are there in Java that you&#146;re used to in C++. There
are only three syntactic differences between these examples: <tt>public</tt>, which
we&#146;ll examine in more depth later, <tt>boolean</tt> instead of <tt>bool</tt>, and <tt>array.length</tt>.
The first two are fairly inconsequential, but the last is significant: in Java, array
notation is not just a different way of writing pointer arithmetic: arrays are treated as
real objects, and they carry their lengths with them. So the Java function doesn&#146;t
have to rely on the caller to tell it how long the array is, and it doesn't have to trust
that the caller told the truth: in Java, the function <i>knows</i> how big the array is,
because the array carries its length with it.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want a generalized bubble-sort routine that will work on any type,
you can use templates in C++. Java doesn&#146;t have templates, so generalizing the
bubble-sort routine is somewhat more complicated, although it can still be done.</p>

<p>The above example hides some of the more important differences between Java and C++,
however. To take a quick look at some of the differences, we&#146;ll consider a whole
program: everyone&#146;s favorite, the &quot;Hello, world&quot; program. In C++, it
generally looks something like this: </p>

<pre>#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

void main() {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
}</pre>

<p>In Java, this example looks quite a bit different: </p>

<pre>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    }
}</pre>

<p>We&#146;ll take a much more in-depth look at all of these differences in future
columns, but for now, we&#146;ll highlight a few of them: 

<ul>
  <li>Java doesn&#146;t have <tt>#include</tt>.</li>
  <li>Everything (including the <tt>main()</tt> function) is a member of a class in Java.</li>
  <li>Access specifiers (such as <tt>public</tt>) are part of the declarator syntax in Java,
    and are stated specifically for each individual class member. Classes also have access
    specifiers.</li>
  <li>The <tt>main()</tt> function in Java always takes the argument list, unlike in C++,
    where it can be omitted. As we saw above, the length of the argument list doesn&#146;t
    have to be specified separately because the length is a property of the array that can be
    queried.</li>
  <li>Character strings in Java are full-fledged objects, not merely pointers to memory that
    happen to have certain semantics.</li>
  <li>Calling a static member of a different class has a different syntax in Java than it does
    in C++ (&quot;<tt>System.out.println()</tt>&quot; in C++ would probably look more like
    &quot;<tt>System::out-&gt;println()</tt>&quot;).</li>
  <li>Java doesn&#146;t have operator overloading.</li>
  <li>The C++ and Java I/O systems are completely different.</li>
</ul>

<h3>See the C?</h3>

<p>As you can see, despite their superficial similarities, C++ and Java are very different
languages that evince very different philosophies and objectives. C++ grew out of C, which
was designed from the ground up as a systems programming language. As a systems
programming language, it was designed to allow the programmer to get as close to the
hardware as possible without writing assembly code. As a result, C became known for its
ability to produce small, fast, tight executable code, although it did this at the expense
of portability. Because C was so low-level, however, there was very little that either the
core language or its standard libraries did for you, making many programming tasks
somewhat more complicated. And its syntax could either be concise and expressive or dense
and impenetrable depending on who was doing the coding.</p>

<p>C++ originated as an attempt to ease some of the shortcomings of C and add new
features, including support for object-oriented programming. Over time, new features have
been added to both the core language and the standard libraries at a prodigious rate,
leading to a language that is very powerful, but also very complex. C++ is <i>not</i> a
language for beginning programmers. Some of C++&#146;s complexity and awkwardness lies in
its origins in C. Since one of C++&#146;s original design goals was backward compatibility
with C (i.e., valid C code was also supposed to be valid C++ code), it has maintained its
low-level systems-programming orientation. As new features were added, small, fast code
continued to be a priority, still often at the expense of portability, clarity, or
simplicity.</p>

<p>Despite the superficial similarities, Java originated out of an almost diametrically
opposed set of priorities. Originally designed for TV set-top boxes and other embedded
systems, simplicity and portability ruled the day at the expense of performance (if not
small code size). As Sun realized Java&#146;s value as an Internet programming language,
portability became the primary goal, and such things as the ability to dynamically load
different parts of a running program from different remote sites became more important. As
Java was seen as the language to create little one-task mini-applications
(&quot;applets&quot;) that could be embedded in Web sites, it also acquired a different
set of requirements for the things it should provide in its standard libraries. And as Sun
has come to see Java as possibly the only viable threat to total Microsoft/Windows world
domination, so have the requirements on the language and its standard libraries expanded
to include virtually everything known to man.</p>

<p>So what we&#146;ve gotten is a language that looks kind of like C++, but which is
oriented toward portability, distributed applications, and dynamic binding, and which is
accompanied by a rapidly-growing runtime that is virtually an OS unto itself (and, of
course, there&#146;s JavaOS, which <i>is</i> an OS unto itself). Microsoft likes to
portray Java as &quot;just another programming language,&quot; while Sun likes to portray
Java as something just short of the Second Coming for the computer industry. In some ways,
both are true and both are false. Java can be used quite fruitfully as &quot;just another
programming language,&quot; but is really more than that. And the rise of the Internet and
Java as its lingua franca do promise to wreak dramatic changes in the way both programmers
and civilians interact with computers, but that promise is a long way from full fruition,
and there are a lot of obstacles in the way.</p>

<p>So to some degree, comparing Java to C++ is kind of like comparing apples to oranges.
But comparing apples and oranges is not necessarily a pointless exercise: after all, one
is better to bake into pies and the other makes a better juice to drink with breakfast.
It&#146;s all in what you&#146;re trying to do. Over the coming months, we&#146;ll take a
look at both languages and their standard libraries and try to figure out what
they&#146;re good for. We&#146;ll start our journey next time with a look at both
languages&#146; overall structures and object models. We&#146;ll follow that with a closer
look at Java&#146;s nature as an interpreted, garbage-collected language and what that <i>really</i>
means. After that, we&#146;ll delve into various smaller facets of the languages, such as
exception handling, collections, memory management, file I/O, multithreading support,
distributed-computing support, internationalization, GUI support, and so on, examining the
strengths and weaknesses of each language.</p>

<p>Hope to see you here.</p>
