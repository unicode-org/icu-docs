<h1 align="center">JIT Localization</h1>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">This is a rough draft, just to be
used for informal discussions. Feedback is welcome.</font></p>
<p>In a world of on-demand software components, with arbitrary connections
between those components, it is important to get a sense of where localization
should be done, and how to transmit enough information so that it can be done at
that appropriate place. End-users need to get messages localized to their
languages, messages that not only contain a translation of text, but also
contain variables such as date, time, number formats, and currencies formatted
according to the users' conventions. The strategy for doing <i>JIT localization </i>is
made up of two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Store and transmit <i>neutral-format</i> data wherever possible.
    <ul>
      <li>Neutral-format data is data that is kept in a standard format, no
        matter what the local user's environment is. It is also (loosely) called
        <i>binary data</i>, even though it actually could be represented in many
        different ways, including a textual representation such as in XML.</li>
      <li>Such data should use accepted standards where possible, such as for
        currency codes (see below).</li>
      <li>Textual data should also be in a uniform character set (Unicode/10646)
        to avoid possible data corruption problems when converting between
        encodings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Localize that data as &quot;<i>close</i>&quot; to the end-user as
    possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a number of advantages to this strategy. The longer the data is
kept in a neutral format, the more flexible the entire system is. On a practical
level, if transmitted data is neutral-format, then it is much easier to
manipulate the data, debug the processing of the data, and maintain the software
connections between components.</p>
<p>Once data has been localized into a given language, it can be quite difficult
to programmatically convert that data into another format, if required. This is
especially true if the data contains a mixture of translated text and formatted
variables. Once information has been localized into, say, Romanian, it is much
more difficult to localize that data into, say, French. Parsing is more
difficult than formatting, and may run up against different ambiguities in
interpreting text that has been localized, even if the original translated
message text is available (which it may not be).</p>
<p>Moreover, the closer we are to end- user, the more we know about that user's
preferred formats. If we format dates, for example, at the user's machine, then
it can easily take into account any customizations that the user has specified.
If the formatting is done elsewhere, either we have to transmit whatever user
customizations are in play, or we only transmit the user's locale code, which
may only approximate the desired format. Thus the closer the localization is to
the end user, the less we need to ship all of the user's preferences arond to
all the places that localization could possibly need to be done.</p>
<p>Even though localization should be done as close to the end-user as possible,
there will be cases where different components need to be aware of whatever
settings are appropriate for doing the localization. Thus information such as a
locale code or timezone needs to be communicated between different components.
There are a number of connected issues discussed below.</p>
<h2>Locale Codes</h2>
<p>In most cases, the notion of a locale is fairly well accepted, as well as the
kind of information associated with a given locale code. However, there are a
number of outstanding problems with the current mechanisms naming locales. For
more information, see <a href="language_code_issues.html">language_code_issues.html</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the exact results produced from formatting or parsing text may
vary according to the locale data available on the given machine. That is one
reason why the <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/subgroups/lade/locale/announce.htm">Common
Locale Repository</a> project has been constituted.</p>
<h2>Message Formatting and Exceptions</h2>
<p>Windows (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcesdkr/htm/_wcesdk_win32_FormatMessage.asp">FormatMessage</a>,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemstringclassformattopic1.asp">String.Format</a>),
Java (<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html">MessageFormat</a>)
and ICU (<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/apiref/classMessageFormat.html">MessageFormat</a>,
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/apiref/umsg_8h.html">umsg</a>) all
provide methods of formatting variables (dates, times, etc) and inserting them
at arbitrary positions in a string. This avoids the manual string concatenation
that causes severe problems for localization. The question is, where to do this?
It is especially important since the original code site that originates a
particular message may be far down in the bowels of a component, and passed up
to the top of the component with an exception. So we will take that case as
representative of this class of issues.</p>
<p>There are circumstances where the message can be communicated with a
language-neutral code, such as a numeric error code or mnemonic string key, that
is understood outside of the component. If there are arguments that need to
accompany that message, such as a number of files or a datetime, those need to
accompany the numeric code so that when the localization is finally at some
point, the full information can be presented to the end-user. This is the best
case for localization.</p>
<p>More often, the exact messages that could originate from within the component
are not known outside of the component itself; or at least they may not be known
by the component that is finally displaying text to the user. In such a case,
the information as to the user's locale needs to be communicated in some way to
the component that is doing the localization. That locale information does not
necessarily need to be communicated deep within the component; ideally, any
exceptions should bundle up some language-neutral message ID, plus the arguments
needed to format the message (e.g. datetime), but not do the localization at the
throw site. This approach has the advantages noted above for JIT localization.</p>
<p>In addition, exceptions are often caught at a higher level; they don't end up
being displayed to any end-user at all. By avoiding the localization at the
throw site, it the cost of doing formatting, when that formatting is not really
necessary. In fact, in many running programs most of the exceptions that are
thrown at a low level never end up being presented to an end-user, so this can
have considerable performance benefits.</p>
<h2>Currencies</h2>
<p>There is some confusion over the use of currencies that should be addressed.
A currency amount logically consists of a numeric value, plus an accompanying <a class="btmlink" href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Portfolio+of+Products+and+Services/Books+Guides/Consumer/th42090.xalter">ISO
4217</a> currency code (or equivalent). The currency code may be implicit in a
protocol, such as where USD is implicit. But if the raw numeric value is
transmitted without any context, then it has no definitive interpretation.</p>
<p>Notice that the currency code is completely independent of the end-user's
language or locale. For example, RUR is the code for Russian Rubles. A currency
amount of &lt;RUR, 1.23457×10³&gt; would be localized for a Russian user into
&quot;1&nbsp;234,57&#1088;.&quot; (using U+0440 (&#1088;) <span style="font-variant: small-caps">cyrillic
small letter er</span>). For an English user it would be localized into the
string &quot;Rub 1,234.57&quot; The end-user's language is needed for doing this
last localization step; but that language is completely orthogonal to the
currency code needed in the data. After all the same English user could be
working with dozens of currencies. (See for example: <a href="http://nsdsa.phdnswc.navy.mil/mspecs/docs/styleman2000/chapter_txt-17.html#17t6">NSDSA
Currency Table</a> and <a href="http://www.unece.org/etrades/unedocs/repository/codelists/xml/CurrencyCodeList.xml">UNECE
Currency Data</a>.) Notice also that the currency code is also independent of
whether currency values are inter-converted, which requires more interesting
financial processing: the rate of conversion may depend on a variety of factors.</p>
<p>Thus logically speaking, once a currency amount is entered into a system, it
should be logically accompanied by a currency code in all processing. This
currency code is independent of whatever the user's original locale was. IOnly
in badly-designed software is the currency code (or equivalent) not present, so
that the software has to &quot;guess&quot; at the currency code based on the
user's locale.</p>
<h2>Time Zones</h2>
<p>A similar issue arises with time. Transmitting &quot;14:30&quot; with no
other context is incomplete unless it contains information about the time zone.
Ideally one would transmit neutral-format date/time information, commonly in
UTC, and localize as close to the user as possible. (For more about UTC, see <a href="http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/">NIST
Time and Frequency Division Home Page</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/faq/docs/UT.html">U.S.
Naval Observatory: What is Universal Time?</a>.)</p>
<p>The conversion from local time into UTC depends on the particular time zone
rules, which will vary by location. The standard data used for converting local
time (sometimes called <i>wall time</i>) to UTC and back is the <a href="ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/">Olson
data</a>, used by UNIX, Java, ICU, and others. The data includes rules for
matching the laws for time changes in different countries. For example, for the
US it is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;During the period commencing at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the first
  Sunday of April of each year and ending at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last
  Sunday of October of each year, the standard time of each zone established by
  sections 261 to 264 of this title, as modified by section 265 of this title,
  shall be advanced one hour...&quot; (United States Law - 15 U.S.C.
  §6(IX)(260-7)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each region that has a different timezone or daylight savings time rules,
either now or at any time in the past, is given a unique internal ID, such as <code>Europe/Paris</code>.
As with currency codes, these are internal codes that should be localized if
exposed to a user (such as in the Windows<i> Control Panels&gt;Date/Time&gt;Time
Zone</i>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, laws change over time, and will continue to change in the
future, both for the boundaries of timezone regions and the rules for daylight
savings. Thus the Olson data is continually being augmented. Any two
implementations using the same version of the Olsen data will get the same
results for the same IDs (assuming a correct implementation). However, if
implementations use different versions of the data they may get different
results. So if precise results are required then both the Olson ID and the Olson
data version must be transmitted between the different implementations.</p>
<p>There are, however, circumstances where extra information needs to be stored
along with the UTC data, especially with recurring events. For example, suppose
that I specify that a delivery is to be made each day at 14:30 PT (Pacific
Time). One cannot simply store that the delivery is to be made at 22:30 UTC,
since that would be 14:30 PT during the winter and 15:30 PT during the summer.
Recurring times are subject to a number of other complications. For example,
suppose I specified 14:30 PT each <i>business</i> day; one would need to know
what constitutes a &quot;business day&quot;, which may depend on federal, state,
or local laws. Other complications arise when one considers events at the same,
such as deliveries at 14:30 in multiple states.</p>
