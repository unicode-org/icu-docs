Minutes
=======
Markus: We should be able to ship ICU by the end of the month
Mark: Gave update of CLDR status. We should be releasing CLDR 1.0 by end of the month
Markus: Home page improved and update with performance chart
Mark: To work on clearing the misconceptions regarding CLDR and ICU on gnome list by pointing to some hard data
Tex: Suggests that charts should be targetted towards 2 types of audience.
     i)  Audience familiar with Unicode and ICU
     ii) Audience not familiar with Unicode and ICU.
Mark: A link for neophytes is a good idea
Tex: The homepage should have information from a high level perspective
Doug: The homepage is a place to show neophytes that ICU is what they really need from a high level perspective, 
      just hit the real basic information.
Mark: We should Reorganize the ICU homepage
Tex: The left hand bar should be more concise.
Doug: A developer page and neophyte page should be prepared
Mark: Scenario's of usage for getLocale API
      i)  Valid locale
      ii) Real locale
      iii)Actual locale
Markus: We used to rely on the warning codes for UErrorCode and subsequently we found that relying on warning codes is unrealiable
        The intent for getLocale is that you can answer the questions
Mark: We need to think about a nice static API on a service to get the functionally distinct locales
Markus: Part of the question what getAvailableLocales return
Mark: getAvailable will always return all the valid locales for the service
Mark: We need to revisit getLocale API
Mark: We need to think about how APIs that aid UI display of formats
