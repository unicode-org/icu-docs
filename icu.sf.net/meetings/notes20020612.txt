1) Who are PMC members?
Yves and Tex left their companies - who is the PMC member? Individual or company? We will keep Yves & Tex on the list until decided otherwise. 
Tex has an alternate, but doesn't know position of Progress - need to contact Steve Watt & Progress and see what they want to do.

2) Data Loading - Yves and Andy are NOT on the line - probably cannot decide on this now.
Steven: - we have loading based on whatever is requested from ICU to be built and whatever is in converter alias table and can be opened at the time of the request. This list is built once and always kept around, even after flushCache - need to change this. reslocal.mk - adds locales to the list of installed locales. The locale list is another resource bundle file. 
Converter listing is complicated - there are subtables etc. Not easy to build the static list.
Tex wants adding files to be as simple as possible. Converters do that through the alias table.

... Long discussion followed ...

We are going to discuss data loading more in-house, polish the design and publish it again.
