<h2>Reorganize ICU Website </h2>

Options:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Keep Sourceforge.net as mirror.&nbsp;</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>Maintenance hassle unless we can keep them in synch mechanically.</li>

  
  </ul>

  <li>icu-project.org contains all web connect and sourceforge.net
contains only download page and redirect pages to icu-project.org
website.</li>

</ol>

Decision: Most of the members prefer Option 2 and keep the option for setting up mechanical mirrors open.<br>

<br>

Steven &nbsp;checked Sourceforge.net for custom error pages and found that it is possible.<br>

<h2>getLocalizedPattern() APIs in ICU</h2>

<h3>Issue</h3>

getLocaledPattern() APIs depend on localizedPatternChars in CLDR. CLDR
has deprected localizedPatternChars and going forward there will not be
any more updated to these items. When additional pattern characters are
added to DateFormat, NumberFormat, etc., the tests in ICU fail because
they check the length of known patterns and then compare with the
length of data fetched from the bundle, when the lengths don't match,
the tests fail. Since these APIs are marked @stable in ICU, we need to
decide what should be done. <br>

<br>

Doug: Deprecating the APIs is problematic since ICU4J must be kept in synch with JDK.<br>

Mark: We can deprecate this API in ICU4C and document that use of this API is highly discouraged in ICU4J<br>

<br>

<h2>Maintenance of Convrtrs.txt</h2>

<h3>Issue</h3>

Adding and removing converters &nbsp;is currently done by hand, so this
system is very fragile. Some tables do not exist but they &nbsp;are in
the repository. To add tables, there are a set of documented steps that
need to be done, but we should investigate if we can automate this
process.<br>

<br>

Deborah: We could put the aliases in the UCM files and assemble cnvrtrs.txt at build time.<br>

Steven: There are technical problems for assembling this information
from the UCM files. UCM files are mechanically generated from files that
do not have this information.<br>

George: Most of the time adding aliases is a judgment call, moreover the gencnval tool checks for errors.<br>

<br>

Decision:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Document that cnvrtrs.txt must be updated in ucmfiles.mk or ucmlocal.mk</li>

  <li>Schedule time for converter packs</li>

  <li>Work on a master table that contains all aliases</li>

  <li>Investigate preference ordering system such that if one file is removed, the other becomes the default</li>

</ol>
