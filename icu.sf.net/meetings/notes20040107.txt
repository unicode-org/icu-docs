ICU Phone Meeting

ICU 2.8 Alpha release - bug fixes, etc.
Apple's next release, uses 3.0. Will integrate 2.8 in next few weeks.
Tex looked at features, will look at converters.

Discussed CLDR Status. Goal to keep 1.0 stable, work on 1.0.1

Discussion of 3.0 features (see memo)

3.0 significant? A new plateau? Aiming at small features, not big ones. 
 Need to make this clear to community.
Explained relation of CLDR to ICU, and plan for direct reading of XML.

For 2.8, first release using CLDR.

Me: Send Joyce the timeline asap.

Deborah:
 - supporting different noun forms for months
  - Mark - add stand-alone names to LDML
 - relative dates
  - add LDML
 - localization of duration
  - use RBNF possible, but need C API

Expose more things through C API
 - date/time/number formatting/scanning (rule based)
 - regular expressions

Adopt ICU text breaking

Add tools for making localization easier

Testing - completely separate API test

Publish performance improvement figures for RBBI.
