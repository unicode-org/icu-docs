<h1>ICU Data Loading, Packaging, Installation, Update, Customization</h1>
<p align="right">Markus Scherer, 20050824..26</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Several ways to build/load/ship ICU and ICU-application data.</p>
<p>Hard to change data: Updating a .dat package means extracting all items and a
manifest file via decmn, modifying the files and the manifest in the file
system, swapping new items to the common type, repackaging with gencmn, and
maybe swapping again to a new type. (All of this can be done with icupkg [below]
with a single command-line invocation.) We also use index files for getAvailable()
functions, and one would have to manually update these index files, at least for
ICU4C.</p>
<p>Or, starting from a data-source download (now available only through CVS, not
as .zip/.tgz) and modifying files, then packaging. Some of the index files are
generated by the build.</p>
<h2>Not a problem</h2>
<p>This is about packaging and indexing. It is not about changing the format of
.res files or any other ICU data files. It is also not about how ICU4J data is
packaged in general (putting individual data files into the .jar).</p>
<p>However, as a result of the discussion, index files (at least in ICU4C) may
be switched from being .res files to using the existing data format of the
converter alias table. Such index files would probably use only a subset of that
format's capabilities.</p>
<h2>New icupkg tool</h2>
<p>There is a new command-line tool that can create .dat files, swap them,
add/remove/extract and list items, change copyright/comment, input package and
item files in any platform type, output .dat package and extracted files in
desired platform type. It does not yet handle indexes in any way. It could replace
gencmn, decmn, and icuswap completely.</p>
<p>The icupkg tool is not finished. It needs testing/debugging, and if we decide
to use automatically updated index files, such code will need to be written and
integrated. Its package-handling code (mostly a C++ class) has been moved
(aug26) to the
toolutil library so that we can easily reuse this code in other codes, via Java
JNI, etc. icupkg is part of CVS since 20050826.</p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Main design point and recommendation to users: Use .dat package files.
    <ul>
      <li>Portable (within l, b, e platforms).</li>
      <li>Can be taken apart &amp; updated.</li>
      <li>Can be used without file system access if application provides
        pointer.</li>
      <li>Built without (sometimes expensive or not installed) platform build
        tools (assembler, compiler, linker).</li>
      <li>Needs only a single copyright statement per package.</li>
      <li>Runtime: Needs either a hardcoded path, or a provided path, or a
        provided pointer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use index files inside .dat packages for getAvailable() functions, for .cnv
    and .res items.</li>
  <li>Use cnvalias.icu file format for index files.
    <ul>
      <li>Use aliases for iw=he and for validSubLocales etc. (We currently use
        empty resource bundles instead.)</li>
      <li>Single format for indexes (rather than two or more) reduces code for
        merging &amp; updating indexes.</li>
      <li>This format needed anyway for conversion aliases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provide tool(s) for updating/modifying .dat package files and
    automatically updating and/or merging included indexes.</li>
  <li>Keep DLL packages as an option. (Its one advantage is not requiring
    configuration.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep single files as an option? (Used [e.g. by Apple] for
    adding/overriding packaged items. Harder to update index and/or enumerate
    items.)</li>
  <li>Change default loading from files-then-package to package-only? (We have a
    new function for controlling this in ICU4C 3.4.)</li>
  <li>Should we have the same index/enumeration method in ICU4C and ICU4J? In
    particular, if we choose index files, should we have the very same index
    files and index file formats in ICU4C and ICU4J?</li>
  <li>The new icupkg tool subsumes the functionality of the gencmn, decmn, and
    icuswap tools. Should we remove the older tools because they are not
    necessary any more, or should we keep them for a kind of tool/script
    backward compatibility? Or keep them for one release (as
    &quot;@obsolete&quot;) and then remove them?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>DLLs: Platform-specific (not portable), cannot be taken apart or modified,
    need linker and (on most platforms) assembler or C compiler for building,
    two different ToC formats (embedded .dat vs. pointers from single .obj's).
    Found via system loader without configuration.</li>
  <li>Single files: Large number of files, require file system access, need
    copyright per file.</li>
  <li>Enumerate items rather than using and updating indexes: Needs custom code
    for file systems, easy for .dat packages and DLL packages, needs additional
    method (indexes?!) for aliases. In ICU4J in WebSphere, we don't know yet how
    to enumerate data items, and ICU4J 3.4 uses indexes again.</li>
  <li>Use .res files for .res indexes: Need additional code for merging &amp;
    updating such indexes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>What do we want to achieve? Thoughts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a locale data file, or a localization resource bundle (to application
    data), or a conversion table.
    <ul>
      <li>At build time using the ICU source download.</li>
      <li>After an application and ICU installation have been done on a
        production machine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Change the Swedish time separator character.</li>
  <li>Add/remove items to customize the data file for distribution. Especially
    now that the ICU4C source download contains the .dat package instead of the
    source files. (Without the new icupkg tool, customizing users
    effectively have to download the sources via CVS.)</li>
  <li>Create locale data for a new locale that's not in CLDR. (Requires multiple
    related CLDR files [root, parent, supplemental], some ICU-supplementary
    files, LDML2ICUConverter, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everything here is easy, nor handled nearly completely with the above
proposal.</p>

<h2>Clarification before the discussion</h2>

<p>(Emails 20050824)</p>
<h3>Doug asked</h3>
<p>Here's my thoughts from an ICU4J perspective.</p>
<p>My main concern is to keep it easy for Java users to build and customize
ICU4J with a minimum of tooling. Currently, all you need is Ant, JDK 1.4, and
the ICU4J source jar. ICU4J uses locale-specific .res files (in the main) so
that removing particular resources is 'easy' (disregarding problems that arise
from removing some resources that other resources alias, or messing up
inheritance). Adding resources to our resource tree is not really possible, but
people can build their own resource trees using standard Java resources. I
suspect the main demand is to reduce footprint by removing unused resources.</p>
<p>Requiring an ICU4C tool and accompanying ICU4C installation is a significant
addition to the toolset. I'd like to keep the common case where ICU4J users just
want to trim data in 'chunks'-- e.g. remove a bunch of locales, or all data
related to an unused service-- as simple as it is currently.</p>
<p>Changes to internal structure of the data is simply a porting issue-- ICU4J
needs to know how to read the .res files. If ICU4J retains the per-locale .res
file format ICU4J is pretty much untouched, it already builds its indexes at
build time by looking at what resources are present during the build. They are
simply a list of strings naming the locales.</p>
<p>More significant customization would be done (I presume) by more
sophisticated users who would be willing to install ICU4C and learn (at least)
to use the tool. If ICU4J retains the per-locale res file model, then ideally
these users could download the ICU .dat files and then use the tool to create
the per-locale .res files (I don't know the tool's capabilities) without having
to know how to build ICU and run other tools to do this. One-stop shopping is a
plus here.</p>
<p>A Java tool that provided a GUI, and used ICU4JNI or called the ICU4C tool
directly, would be a plus.</p>
<h3>Markus replied</h3>
<p>Doug, your concern is perfectly placed. Let me clarify.</p>
<p>The proposal does not change at all how ICU4J stores and loads .res files. If
someone works from a .jar file or from its extracted contents, then nothing on
that level will change. Changing the internal structure of .res files is not on
the table.</p>
<p>The part of the discussion that affects ICU4J is the question of whether to
use index files for getAvailable() and for aliases/equivalents/validSubLocales,
or whether instead to enumerate the relevant items. We should have the same
solution (index vs. enumeration) for both ICU4C and ICU4J.</p>
<p>The real change here would be that the index file would come from ICU4C (and
an ICU4C tool) instead of from the ICU4J build process.</p>
<p>In addition, if we decide to go with index files, we need to decide whether
to keep them in resource bundle format, or whether to use the data format of the
conversion alias table. (The latter's source text form is actually simpler to
edit than resource bundle sources.)</p>
<p>For generating new .res files, ICU4J already relies on ICU4C tools. If we add
tool support for updating index files, this may or may not mean another ICU4C
tool for that.</p>
<p>Another possible impact of the discussion on ICU4J: Ram has written a script
that takes the ICU4C data, generates the Unicode properties files, and creates
the ICU4J data .jar file. If the input to this script is a .dat package, then
updating the .dat package with tools would also be a way to customize ICU4J
data. The index files would be updated automatically before the script gets the
.dat file.</p>
<p>Yes, the new icupkg tool (and the old decmn tool) can take a .dat file and
extract all of the .res and other items in it as separate files. (Much like
unzip.)</p>
