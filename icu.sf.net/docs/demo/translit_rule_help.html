      <h1>Transform Rule Editor Help</h1>

<p>The rule editor allows one to enter and modify transform rules. The rules are 
compiled into a new transform and may be saved for use in the main transform 
demo window.</p>

<h2>How To Use The Editor</h2>

<p>Enter the rules in the text area. When finished, 
press the <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Save As...</strong> button. This will attempt 
to compile the rules. If there are any problems, an error message will be displayed at the 
bottom of the window. You can then correct the problem and try again.</p>

<p>To remove a rule set, select it in the pop-up 
list and press the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>

<h2>Using New Rules</h2>

<p>Once you have created and saved a new rule set, 
you may use it in the main window. To do so, select the rule in the main pop-up or type it 
into the compound ID field and select <strong>(Compound)</strong>.</p>

<h2>System Rules</h2>

<p>System rules may be examined by selecting them in 
the pop-up list. They may then be modified and the modified version may be saved. You must 
select a new name to save the rules under.</p>

<p>The demo does not allow the system 
transforms themselves to be modified in order to minimize confusion. Whenever you 
load the rules for <strong>Latin-Greek</strong>, you are seeing the actual system rules, 
not some user's modification of them.</p>

<h2>How To Write Rules</h2>

<p>Each rule describes two patterns, an <em>input</em> 
pattern and an <em>output</em> pattern. When the input pattern is seen, it is transformed 
into the output pattern. The basic rule syntax is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code><em>input</em> &gt; <em>output</em> ;&nbsp; # comment</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each rule ends with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). The pound character (<code>#</code>) indicates that the rest of the line is a comment.</p>

<p>The input and output patterns may be simple text, 
for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>a &gt; A;&nbsp; # make A's uppercase</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>More complicated patterns may be used to specify 
that certain text must be seen on the left or right; this text is called <em>context</em>, 
and it is matched, but not modified:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>[0-9] {a} &gt; A;&nbsp; # make A's after digits uppercase</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This description only covers the essentials.
