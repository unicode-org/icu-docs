Minutes
======
- Disabling usage of C++ APIs in binary distributions (jb 3598 tied with jb 3405): 

Steven: Can this be handled at link time by not exporting C++ Symbols
Deborah: Would like to control which symbols are exported for developers for guarantee binary compatibility
Steven: Could have 2 directories one with public headers and one with private headers
Deborah: Some sort of #define for hiding draft APIs and C++ APIs, so individual app developers can decide if they need binary compatibility or not
Vladimir: We might be able to get it in 3.0
Consensus: 
#define for hiding draft APIs
#define for hiding C++ APIs

- Doug's opinion/input on what, if any, work remains to support missing JSR-204 APIs in ICU
Doug: Gave a overview of the APIs that Oracle proposed which did not make it to JSR-204

- CLDR
Mark: A version of CLDR should be released for 3.0
Meeting scheduled for Tuesday (9th of march) 8:00am PDT

- BreakIterator tailoring
Deborah: The default rules not acceptable for Japaneese coustomers
Mark: A locale variant in ja locale should be enough
Andy: Conceptually straight forward to pull the rules out of the locale resource bundles but not sure how much work is involved
Mark: Locale is the mechanism to decide which rules to invoke
Mark: Language detection needed in ICU. Mozilla has language detection ... may be leveraged.

Action Items
=========
+ Doug and Craig to develop a minimal set of APIs that should be included in ICU4J and send it out for review
+ Craig to contact Simon Law for figuring out how Oracle should participate in CLDR
