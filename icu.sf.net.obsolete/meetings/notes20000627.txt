    - 1st ICU Developer Workshop Agenda Suggestions. (Helena)
        The consensus is to make sure the dates for these workshop meetings do not conflict the IUC technical 
committee's meetings.  Mark Davis will provide that information when available.  For those who is not attending
the Unicode conference, perhaps a video taped class can be provided for later.
The agenda is currently scheduled to be the Monday following the conference.  Monday will be the beginner's level
session and the next day will focus on the more advanced topics including user experiences.
We will discuss this further in the next meeting.  We will also start signing people up as the volunteers to
host certain sessions.
IBM will be sponsoring this first series of developer workshop meetings.
- Action items from previous meetings
- ICU 1.6 release API freeze deadline 6/29/2000.

- Documentation update.

Roger isn't available at this meeting.  Instead of trying to finish a complete version before making the user's
guide available for public review.  We decided to set the following milestones,
    1. Make the current version available on the oss site.
    2. Set 7/31 as the draft update with organizational changes to include both C and C++ descriptions.
    3. Set 8/31 as the final version of the complete set.  This needs to be available before the ICU workshop
       meetings.
- Attendees by invitation.
    Starting the next meeting, we will start inviting contributors who has major outstanding proposal to be 
review to attend the meeting.  For example, Carl Brown and his Context Object proposal.

- NCR/IBM legal issues.
    Laura is going to discuss the legal issues regarding the licensing agreement and give an udpate.  Tex and 
others will check with their lawyers regarding the license if there's a need to escalate this.

- Technical discussion
     1. IANA name structure.
         Yves will send out the revised IANA name proposal and check in the APIs.  The alias matching proposal will be
revised and sent out by Markus.
     2. Transliterator C APIs.
        Alan will send out the proposal shortly.
     3. Collation enhancements.
        In order to handle the existing CCStr APIs, Helena and Brendan proposed to add additional functionality
to Collator.  The proposal needs to be sent out by the end of today (6/27) and feedback back by (6/29).  Steve W. 
will file a bug regarding ucol_hashKey() API.

- Other agenda items
    None
