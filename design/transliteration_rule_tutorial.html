<h1 align="center">Transliteration Rule Tutorial</h1>
<h2 align="center"><i><b><font color="#FF0000">Rough Draft 2001-08-21</font></b></i></h2>
<p>This is an informal section that describes the process of building a custom 
transliterator from rules. It does not describe in detail the features of 
transliteration; instead, it walks through the process of building rules, 
discussing features needed to perform different tasks. The focus is on building 
a script transliterator.</p>
<h2>Source</h2>
<p>The first thing to decide is which system of transliteration to use as a 
model. There are dozens of different systems for each language and script.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elot.gr/tc46sc2/">ISO</a> uses a strict definition of 
transliteration, which requires it to be be reversible. Although the goal for 
ICU script transliterators is reversibility, they don't have to be. And in 
general, most transliteration systems in use out in the world are not 
reversible. In this tutorial will build a reversible transliterator, since it 
illustrates more of the issues involved in the rules. (For guidelines in 
building transliterators, see &quot;Guidelines for Designing Script 
Transliterations&quot; in the <a
href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Transform.html">ICU User 
Guide</a>.)</p>
<p>Since most transliteration systems are not reversible, that means that even 
once you pick a source, you may have to make some modifications for 
reversibility. Even the very excellent Japanese standard for transliteration 
requires a few tweaks to make it reversible.</p>
<p>There are various collections of transliteration systems out on the web, such 
as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sirbinks/translit.html">http://homepage.mac.com/sirbinks/translit.html</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/">http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For our example, we'll start with a set of rules for Greek, since it provides 
a real example that most people are somewhat familiar with from mathematics. We 
will use rules that do not use the pronunciation of Modern Greek; instead, we 
will aim for rules that correspond to the way that Greek words were adopted into 
English. For example, we will transliterate &quot;Βιολογία-Φυσιολογία&quot; 
as &quot;Biología-Physiología&quot;, not as &quot;Violohía-Fisiolohía&quot;. 
To illustrate some of the trickier cases, we will also transliterate the Greek 
accents that are no longer in use in modern Greek.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b>Note: </b>Some of the characters may not be visible on your 
  screen unless you have a Unicode font with all the Greek letters. If you are 
  licensed for a copy of Microsoft Office, you can use the Arial Unicode 
  MS font, or you can <a href="http://home.att.net/~jameskass/">download the Code2000
  font for free</a>. For more information see <a
  href="http://www.unicode.org/help/display_problems.html"><b>Display Problems?</b></a> 
  on the Unicode site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will also make sure that the mapping is complete; that is, that every 
Latin letter maps back to some Greek letter. This insures that when reversing 
the transliteration, all Latin letters are handled. Notice that this direction 
is <i>not</i> reversible. So in summary, the goal is:</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
      <td width="33%">Source-Target</td>
      <td width="33%">Reversible</td>
      <td width="33%">φ → ph → φ</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="33%">Target-Source</td>
      <td width="33%">Not (Necessarily) Reversible</td>
      <td width="33%">f → φ → ph</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>In the simplest cases, we just have a one-to-one relationship between letters 
in Greek and letters in Latin.</p>
<p>The simplest rules just map between source string and a target string; for 
example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>π &lt;&gt; p;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule says that when you are transliterating from Greek to Latin, convert 
π to p; when you are going the other way, convert p to π. The syntax is just</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>string1 &lt;&gt; string2 ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we will start by adding a whole batch of simple mappings. These won't 
actually work yet, but we will start with them. For now, we won't worry about 
the uppercase versions.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <td width="20%" valign="top">α &lt;&gt; a;<br>

        ψ &gt; ps;<br>
        ω &lt;&gt; ō;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>Quoting</h3>
<p>All of the ASCII characters except numbers and letters are reserved for use 
in the rule syntax. Normally, you won't need to convert these characters. If you 
ever do, you can use either single quotes or a slash. For example, to convert 
from two less-than signs to the word &quot;much less than&quot;, you can use 
either of the two rules:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>\&lt;\&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; much\ less\ than ;<br>
  '&lt;&lt;'&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'much less than' ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that where we needed a real space in the rules, we had to quote it. If 
you want a real backslash, you can either double it \\, or quote it '\'. If you 
want a real single quote, you can double it '', or backslash it \'. Thus each of 
the following means the same thing:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'can''t go'<br>
  'can\'t go'<br>
  can\'t\ go<br>
  can''t' 'go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any text starting with a hash mark, out to the end of a line is a comment. 
This helps to document how your rules work in interesting cases.</p>
<p>Notice that you can insert spaces almost anywhere with no effect on the 
rules. Using extra space allows you to separate items out for clarity without 
worrying about the effects. This feature is particularly useful with combining 
marks; it is handy to put some spaces around it to separate it from the 
surrounding text. Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; ͅ&gt; i ; # an iota-subscript diacritic turns into an i.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to, you can use \u notation instead of any letter. So instead of 
the Greek π, you could write:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">\u03C0</font> &lt;&gt; p ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you find it easier, you can also define and use variables, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">$pi = \u03C0 ;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">$pi</font> &lt;&gt; p ;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>One-way Rules</h3>
<p>For completeness, we need to also map back the Latin letters that are not 
produced by the Greek rules. For example, to have both c and k map to Greek 
KAPPA (κ), and KAPPA map back to k, one can use two rules:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>κ &lt;&gt; k ;<br>
  κ &lt; c ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first rule is reversible, while the second (from target to source) is 
not. Internally, the κ &lt;&gt; k rule is actually just equivalent to a pair of 
one-way rules, so the above could be written equivalently as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>κ &gt; k ;<br>
  κ &lt; k ;<br>
  κ &lt; c ;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Once we have done the simple one-to-one cases, and the few rules for 
completeness, it's time to tackle some trickier items. The first is context. In 
Greek, for example, a γ gets converted to an <i>n</i> if it is before any of 
the characters γ, κ, ξ, or χ , while otherwise it is converted to a <i>g</i>. 
Let's take this one step at a time. We could just list all of the possibilities, 
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>γγ &gt; ng;<br>
  γκ &gt; nk;<br>
  γξ &gt; nx;<br>
  γχ &gt; nch;<br>
  γ &gt; g;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All rules are evaluated in the order you provide, so this means that the 
transliterator will first try matching the first four rules, then if all of them 
fail, use the last one.</p>
<p>However, this method quickly becomes tiresome, especially when you consider 
all the possible combinations of upper and lower case. An alternative is to use 
two additional features: contexts and ranges. We'll start by explaining context. 
Since we already have rules for converting γ, κ, ξ, and χ, the only thing we 
have to do is to convert the γ differently <i>when</i> it is followed by one of 
those, and otherwise let those characters be handled by their own rules. This is 
done with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>γ } γ &gt; n;<br>
  γ } κ &gt; n;<br>
  γ } ξ &gt; n;<br>
  γ } χ &gt; n;<br>
  γ &gt; g;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A left curly brace marks the start of a following context. That context will 
be taken into account when matching the rules against the source text, but won't 
itself be converted. So if we had a sequence γγ, the first γ is converted 
into an <i>n</i> by the first rule, then the second γ -- not matching any of 
the first four rules, matches the last and is converted into a <i>g</i>; thus 
the resulting text is <i>ng</i>.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that we haven't gained much -- we have the same number of 
rules. Now we will use ranges to clean them up. We can collapse the first four 
rules into one, as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>{γ}[γκξχ] &gt; n;<br>
  γ &gt; g;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any list of characters within square braces will match any one of the 
characters. We can then add the uppercase variants for completeness, to get:</p>
<blockquote>
  γ } [ΓΚΞΧγκξχ] &gt; n;<br>
  γ &gt; g;
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that we can use spaces for clarity, so we could also write this as 
the following, if we find it easier to read.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>γ } [ Γ Κ Ξ Χ&nbsp;&nbsp; γ κ ξ χ ] &gt; n ;<br>
  γ &gt; g ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a range of characters happens to have adjacent code numbers, we can just 
use a hyphen to abbreviate it. That is, instead of [a b c d e f g m n o], we can 
write [a-g m-o].</p>
<h3>Styled Text</h3>
<p>There is another reason to use context, instead of just enumerated rules. 
Transliterators will work on styled text. When they do, they copy the style for 
the replaced text to the replacement text. But they can only do that on whole 
replacements, since there is no way to know how any boundaries within the source 
text would line up within the replacement text.</p>
<p>Thus here are the effects of the two types of rules on some sample text. 
Notice that contexts preserve the styles at a much finer granularity.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
      <th width="33%" rowspan="3">Source</th>
      <th width="67%" colspan="2">Rules</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th width="33%">Brute Force</th>
      <th width="34%">Context</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="33%">γγ &gt; ng</td>
      <td width="34%">γ } γ &gt; n;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="33%"><b><font size="5"><font color="#FF0000">γ</font><font
        color="#00FF00">γ</font></font></b></td>
      <td width="33%"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">ng</font></td>
      <td width="34%"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">n</font><font size="5"
        color="#00FF00">g</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>Case</h3>
<p>Let's look at another example where we need context. When converting from 
Greek to Latin, we can just convert θ to and from <i>th</i>. But what happens 
with the uppercase theta (Θ)? Sometimes it needs to convert to <i>TH</i>, and 
sometimes to <i>Th</i>. We can choose between these based on the letters before 
and afterwards: if there is a lowercase letter after, we can choose <i>Th</i>, 
otherwise we'll use <i>TH</i>. While this rule is not perfect, it gives 
satisfactory results in practice.</p>
<p>We could go through and manually list all the lowercase letters, but there is 
a far easier way to do it. Ranges not only list characters explicitly; they also 
give you access to all the characters that have a given Unicode property. The 
abbreviations are a bit arcane, but allow use to easily specify common sets of 
characters, like all the uppercase letters.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Θ } [:Ll:] &lt;&gt; Th;<br>
  Θ &lt;&gt; TH;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That allows words like Θεολογικές to map to <i>Theologikés</i> and 
not <i>THeologikés</i>!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b>you can either specify properties with POSIX-style syntax, as 
  [:Ll:], or with Perl-style syntax, as \p{Ll} -- whichever you find more 
  readable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Properties and Variables</h3>
<p>A Greek sigma is written as ς&nbsp; if it is at the end of a word (but not 
completely separate) and as σ otherwise. When converting from Greek to Latin, 
this is not a problem, but when converting back it is. We need to convert an <i>s</i> 
depending on the context. While we could list all possible letters in a range, 
there is an easier way -- with a character property. The range [:L:] stands for 
all letters, so we can use that. But what we really want are all the characters 
that <i>aren't</i> letters. That can be done with a negated range: [:^L:]. Here 
is what we get:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>σ &lt; [:^L:] { s } [:^L:] ;<br>
  ς &lt; s } [:^L:] ;<br>
  σ &lt; s ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rules say: if an <i>s</i> is surrounded by non-letters, convert it to a 
σ. Otherwise, if it is followed by a non-letter, convert it to a ς. If all 
else fails, convert it to σ.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Negated ranges [^...] will also match before the start of a 
  string, and after the end of a string, which makes the rules <i>much</i> 
  easier to write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you may find the above rules a bit ugly. If you want to make the rules 
clearer, you can use variables. Instead of the above, we can write:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>$nonletter = [:^L:] ;</p>
  <p>σ &lt; $nonletter { s } $nonletter ;<br>
  ς &lt; s } $nonletter ;<br>
  σ &lt; s ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many more properties available, and you can use combinations of 
them. For example:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Combination</th>
    <th align="left">Example</th>
    <th align="left">Description: All code points that are:</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Union</th>
    <td>[[:Greek:] [:L:]]</td>
    <td>either in the Greek script, or are letters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Intersection</th>
    <td>[[:Greek:] [:L:]]</td>
    <td>are both Greek and letters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Set Difference</th>
    <td>[[:Greek:] - [:L:]]</td>
    <td>are Greek but not letters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Complement</th>
    <td>[^[:Greek:] [:L:]]</td>
    <td>are neither Greek nor letters</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For more on properties, see <a
href="unicodeset_properties.htm">UnicodeSet 
Properties</a>.</p>
<h3>Repetition</h3>
<p>Elements in a rule can also repeat. For example, In the following rules, an 
iota-subscript is converted into a capital I if the preceding base letter is 
uppercase. Otherwise it converts to a lowercase.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[:Lu:] {&nbsp; ͅ } &gt; I;<br>
  &nbsp; ͅ &gt; i;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this is not sufficient, since the base letter may be optionally 
followed by non-spacing marks. To capture that, we can use the * syntax, which 
means <i>repeat zero or more times.</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[:Lu:] [:Mn:] * {&nbsp; ͅ } &gt; I ;<br>
  &nbsp; ͅ &gt; i ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three operators that can be used for this, as in the table below.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
    <caption><b>Repetition Operators</b></caption>
    <tr>
      <td>X *</td>
      <td>zero or more X's</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>X +</td>
      <td>one or more X's</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>X ?</td>
      <td>zero or one X</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>These operators can also be used with sequences, with parentheses for 
grouping. For example, &quot;a ( b c ) * d&quot; will match against 
&quot;ad&quot; or &quot;abcd&quot; or &quot;abcbcd&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Technical Note: </b>There is a current limitation on repetition 
  operators. They are always <i>greedy with no backup.</i> What this odd jargon 
  means is that any repetition will cause the sequence to match as many times as 
  allowed, even if that causes the rest of the rule to fail. For example, 
  suppose we have the following (contrived) rules:</p>
  <p>a [:L:]* { e } &gt; æ ;<br>
  e &gt; é ;</p>
  <p>Clearly the intent was to transform sequences like &quot;able blue&quot; 
  into &quot;ablæ blué&quot;. It doesn't work, however, and just produces 
  &quot;ablé blué&quot;. The problem is that when the left side is matched 
  against the text in the first rule, the [:L:]* matches all the way back 
  through the &quot;al&quot;. Then there is no &quot;a&quot; left to match. To 
  have it match properly, you have to rework the rules a bit, to subtract the 
  'a'.</p>
  <p>a [[:L:]-[a]]* { e } &gt; æ ;<br>
  e &gt; é ;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Accents</h3>
<p>You could handle each accented characters by itself, with rules such as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ά &gt; á;<br>
  έ &gt; é;<br>
  ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gets complicated if you consider all the possible combinations of 
accents, and the fact that the text might not be normalized. One feature of ICU 
2.0 that helps a great deal is the ability to add other transliterators as 
rules, either before or after all the other rules. The syntax uses a double 
colon. With this, you can have the rules:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>::NFD;<br>
  α &lt;&gt; a;<br>
  ...<br>
  ω &lt;&gt; ō;<br>
  :: NFC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this does is first separate all accents from their base characters and 
put them in a canonical order. Your rules can then deal with the individual 
components, as desired. You then use NFC at the end to put the entire result 
into standard canonical form.</p>
<p>If desired, a filter can also be used with the transliterator, so you could 
say</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>:: [[:Greek:][:Inherited:]] NFD;<br>
  α &lt;&gt; a;<br>
  ...<br>
  ω &lt;&gt; ō;<br>
  :: [[:Latin:][:Inherited:]] NFC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will cause NFD to only be applied to Greek characters plus inherited 
(which are combining marks), and the final NFC to only be applied to letters 
that are either Latin or inherited, so as to disturb other scripts less. 
However, this would still disturb the Latin characters that were originally in 
the text. To limit the actions even more, you can have a global filter at the 
start. That will cause <i>all</i> of the rules and transliterators to be limited 
in scope, and only apply to the characters that matched the filter. This would 
look like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>:: [[:Greek:][:Inherited:]] ;<br>
  :: NFD;<br>
  α &lt;&gt; a;<br>
  ...<br>
  ω &lt;&gt; ō;<br>
  :: NFC;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Disambiguation</h3>
<p>Let's revisit what we did with γ, sometimes turning it into an <i>n. </i>Here 
we hit a little gotcha. If the transliteration is to be completely reversible, 
what would happen if we happened to have the Greek combination νγ? Since ν 
also goes to <i>n</i>, we have an ambiguity. Now, normally this sequence does 
not occur in Greek. However, for consistency -- and especially to aid in 
mechanical testing, we still want to handle this case. (There are other cases in 
this and other languages where both sequences to occur.)</p>
<p>To handle this, we use the mechanism recommended by the Japanese or Korean 
transliteration standards, and insert an apostrophe or hyphen to disambiguate 
the results. So we add a rule that inserts an apostrophe after an <i>n</i> if 
the reverse transliteration.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ν } [ΓΚΞΧγκξχ] &gt; n\';</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the Greek rules in ICU, you will see quite a number of these. 
The ICU rules undergo some fairly rigorous mechanical testing to ensure 
reversibility. Adding these hyphen rules ensure that they can pass these tests, 
and handle all possible sequences of characters correctly.</p>
<p>There are some forms that normally never occur in some context (in normal 
text). By convention, we use &quot;~&quot; for such cases to allow a reversible 
transliteration. Thus if you had the text &quot;Θεολογικές (ς)&quot;, 
it would transliterate to &quot;<i>Theologikés</i> (~s)&quot;. Using this 
character allows the reverse transliteration to detect it, and convert correctly 
back to the original: &quot;Θεολογικές (ς)&quot;. Similarly, if we 
had the odd phrase &quot;Θεολογικέσ&quot;, it would transliterate to 
&quot;<i>Theologiké~s&quot;</i>. These are called <i>anomalous</i> characters.</p>
<h3>Revisiting</h3>
<p>Rules allow for characters to be revisited <i>after</i> they are replaced. 
For example, the following converts C back S in front of E, I or Y. The vertical 
bar means that the character will be revisited, so that the S or K in a Greek 
transliterator will be applied to the result, eventually producing a sigma (Σ, 
σ, or ς) or kappa (Κ or κ).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>$softener = [eiyEIY] ;<br>
  <br>
  | S &lt; C } $softener ;<br>
  | K &lt; C ;<br>
  | s &lt; c } $softener ;<br>
  | k &lt; c ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ability to revisit is surprisingly powerful. It is particularly useful in 
reducing the number of rules required for a given language. For example, in 
Japanese there are a large number of cases that follow the same pattern: &quot;kyo&quot; 
maps to a large hiragana for &quot;ki&quot; (き) followed by a small hiragana 
for &quot;yo&quot; (ょ). This can be done with a small number of rules with the 
following pattern.</p>
<p>First, the ASCII punctuation mark &quot;~&quot; is used to represent 
characters that never normally occur in isolation. This is a general convention 
for anomalous characters within the ICU rules in any event.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'~yu' &gt; ゅ;<br>
  '~ye' &gt; ぇ;<br>
  '~yo' &gt; ょ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, any syllables that use this pattern are broken into the first 
hiragana, followed by letters which will form the small hiragana.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>by &gt; び|'~y';<br>
  ch &gt; ち|'~y';<br>
  dj &gt; ぢ|'~y';<br>
  gy &gt; ぎ|'~y';<br>
  j &gt; じ|'~y';<br>
  ky &gt; き|'~y';<br>
  my &gt; み|'~y';<br>
  ny &gt; に|'~y';<br>
  py &gt; ぴ|'~y';<br>
  ry &gt; り|'~y';<br>
  sh &gt; し|'~y';</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these rules, &quot;kyo&quot; is first transformed into &quot;き~yo&quot;. 
Since the &quot;~yo&quot; is then revisited, this produces the desired final 
result &quot;きょ&quot;. Thus a small number of rules (3 + 11 = 14) provide 
for a large number of cases. If all of the combinations of rules were used 
instead, it would require 3 × 11 = 33 rules.</p>
<p>You can set the new revisit point (called the <i>cursor</i>) anywhere in the 
replacement text. You can even set the revisit point before or after the 
replaced text. The at-sign is used as a filler to indicate the position, for 
those cases. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[aeiou] { x &gt; | @ ks ;<br>
  ak &gt; ack ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first rule will convert <i>x</i>, when preceded by a vowel, into <i>ks</i>. 
It will then backup to before the vowel and continue. In the next pass, the 
&quot;ak&quot; will match, and be invoked. Thus if the source text is 
&quot;ax&quot;, the result will be &quot;ack&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Technical Note: Although you can move the cursor forward or backward, it is 
  limited in two ways: (a) to the text that is matched, (b) within the original 
  substring that is to be converted. For example, suppose you have the rule 
  &quot;a b* {x} &gt; |@@@@@y&quot;, and it matches in the text &quot;mabbx&quot;. 
  The result will be &quot;m|abby&quot;, where | represents the cursor position. 
  That is, even though there are five @ signs, the cursor will only backup to 
  the first character that is matched.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Copying</h3>
<p>You can copy part of the matched string to the replacement text. You do this 
by grouping the text you want copied with parenthesis, and using $<i>n</i> 
(where <i>n</i> is a number from 1 to 99) to indicate which grouping you want. 
For people who know regular expressions, this should be familiar. For example, 
here is a case from Korean. What happens is that any vowel that doesn't have a 
consonant before it gets the <i>null</i> consonant (<span class="unicode">ᄋ</span>) 
inserted before it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>([aeiouwy]) &gt; ᄋ| $1 ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then you want to revisit the vowel again, so the easiest way is to insert 
the null consonant, then the vowel, but then backup before the vowel to 
reconsider it. Similarly, we have a rule that inserts a null vowel (<span
class="unicode">ᅳ</span>), if no real vowel is found after a consonant:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>([b-dg-hj-km-npr-t]) &gt; | $1 eu;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, since we are going to reconsider the text again we put in the 
Latin equivalent of the Korean null vowel, which is <i>eu</i>.</p>
<h3>Order Matters</h3>
<p>Two rules <i>overlap</i> when is some text that they both could match. For 
example, the first of the following rules does not overlap either of the other 
two, but the second two overlap.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>β &gt; b;<br>
  γ } [ Γ Κ Ξ Χ&nbsp;&nbsp; γ κ ξ χ ] &gt; n ;<br>
  γ &gt; g ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When rules don't overlap, they will produce the same result no matter what 
order they are in. It doesn't matter whether we have:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>β &gt; b;<br>
  γ &gt; g ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>γ &gt; g ;<br>
  β &gt; b;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When rules <i>do</i> overlap, order <i>is</i> important. In fact, a rule 
could be rendered completely useless. Suppose we have:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>β } [aeiou] &gt; b;<br>
  β } [^aeiou] &gt; v;<br>
  β &gt; p;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the last rule is <i>masked</i>; there is <i>no</i> text that 
will match it that would not already be matched by previous rules. If a rule is 
masked, then a warning will be issued when you attempt to build a transliterator 
with the rules.</p>
<h3>Combinations</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at a trickier example that combines a few of these 
features. In Greek, a rough breathing mark on one of the first two vowels in a 
word represents an <i>H.</i> (It is invalid to occur anywhere else, so we won't 
worry about other cases.) In normalized (NFD) form, the rough-breathing mark 
will be first first accent after the vowel (with perhaps other accents 
following). So, we will start with the following variables and rule. The rule 
transforms a rough breathing mark into an <i>H</i>, and moves it to before the 
vowels.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>$gvowel = [ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩαεηιουω];<br>
  <br>
  ($gvowel + ) ̔ &gt; H | $1;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a word like <span class="unicode">ὍΤΑΝ</span>. is transformed into <i>HOTAN</i>. 
So far, so good. But this doesn't work with a lowercase word like <span
class="unicode">ὅταν</span>. To handle that, we insert another rule, 
whereby we move the <i>H</i> over lowercase vowels, we will change it to 
lowercase.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>$gvowel = [ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩαεηιουω];<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">$lcgvowel = [αεηιουω];<br>
  <br>
  ($lcgvowel +) ̔ &gt; h | $1;&nbsp; # fix lowercase<br>
  </font>($gvowel + ) ̔ &gt; H | $1;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us the correct results for lowercase: <span class="unicode">ὅταν 
</span>is transformed into <i>hotan</i>. That handles the lowercase situation. 
But there is a third possibility, a titlecase word like <span class="unicode">Ὅταν</span>. 
For that, we need to actually lowercase the uppercase letters as we pass over 
them, and we need to do that in two circumstances: (a) the breathing mark is on 
a capital letter followed by a lowercase, or (b) the breathing mark is on a 
lowercase vowel.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>$gvowel = [ΑΕΗΙΟΥΩαεηιουω];<br>
  $lcgvowel = [αεηιουω];<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0000FF">{Ο&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ̔&nbsp; } [:Mn:]* [:Ll:] &gt; H | 
  ο;&nbsp; # fix Titlecase<br>
  {Ο ( $lcgvowel * )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ̔&nbsp; } &gt; H | ο $1;&nbsp; # fix 
  Titlecase<br>
  </font><br>
  ( $lcgvowel + )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ̔ &gt; h | $1 ;<font color="#0000FF">&nbsp; 
  # fix lowercase</font><br>
  ($gvowel + )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ̔ &gt; H | $1 ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us the correct results for lowercase: <span class="unicode">Ὅταν 
</span>is transformed into <i>Hotan</i>. We'll have to copy the above insertion 
and modify it for each of the vowels, since each has a different lowercase.</p>
<p>That leaves one last tricky situation: a single letter word like <span
class="unicode">ὃ</span>. In that case, we would need to look beyond the word, 
either forward or backward, to know whether to transform it to <i>HO</i> or to <i>Ho</i>. 
Unlike the case of a capital theta (Θ), there are cases in Greek of 
single-vowel words, with rough breathing marks. This last one is left for the 
reader. (Hint: you'll probably use several rules, to match either before or 
after the word, ignoring certain characters like punctuation and space. Watch 
out for combining marks also.)</p>
