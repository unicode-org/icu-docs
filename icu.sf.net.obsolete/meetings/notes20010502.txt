Agenda items:

- Lotus Notes will use 2 collations
  + old, compatible collation
  + new one based on ICU/UCA
  + database designers etc. will be able to choose

- collation performance
  - achieved good speedups
  - the recent primary key compression made sort key generation somewhat slower but
    shortened sort keys for some locales by up to 30%
  - sort keys a lot shorter than in Windows
  - speed and sort key sizes much better than UTF-8 locales in Solaris 5.6/glibc 2.1
  - should put some text onto collation design doc (Mark)

- check ICU API to get Windows LCID
  - works from locale data?
  - make it work simpler/better if on Windows?

- George is working on ICU porting to include MacOS and AS/400
  - Lotus will need ICU on the Mac
  - three flavors of MacOS
    + classic
    + OS X
    + OS X with "Carbon" library which is available for 8.1 and up
  - Jim what exactly to support:
    + next version of Notes will require the Carbon library
  - Lotus has 1.8 working on Mac/Carbon with small changes
  - Lotus Mac development uses Lotus cross-platform build system,
    does not need nor use CodeWarrior files

- Andy: environment variables are problematic
  - Lotus uses .dat files and calls udata_setCommonData()

- Ram: made ISO 2022-JP 25% faster by using macros
  - Andy: inline helps a lot, use when possible even with C code depending on compiler
  - suggest U_INLINE and define as "inline" when possible
  - have functions defined first that are used by later ones to help compiler
    automatically inline
  - should check with users if simple .cpp code is ok or pure .c is preferred

- Mark: need schedule for "Mini-releases"/"stable builds"
  - for demos like locale explorer
  - for users like Lotus
  - on demand?
  - just tag cvs with "snapshot-20010502"
  - snapshots may contain more changes than what goes into future maintenance releases
    + say so in readme
