<h1>ICU Code Contributions</h1>
<p> The overwhelming majority (&#8773;99.7%) 
of all code has been contributed by IBM employees, or by people under 
contract to IBM. The following lists the contributions from non-IBMers. Except 
for some minor contributions, these are all covered by <a href="Copyright_Assignment.rtf">Joint 
Copyright Assignment</a> letters between IBM and the contributors.</p>

<p>Contributions are to ICU4C for the most part, except for those to ICU4J as
noted above. Many of the contributions to one ICU deliverable (ICU4C/ICU4J) were
later ported to the other.</p>
<p>The lines of code are approximate: in many cases the code has been
rewritten since the contribution, so it is sometimes difficult to determine the
origin of any particular line.</p>
<h2><a name="lines_of_code">Lines of Code</a></h2>
<p>Lines of code counted on this page include all source code files,
including samples, tools, tests, etc.
and count all lines regardless of the number of statements, comments, or empty lines.
The numbers do not include data files, such as locale data or conversion data,
nor make files or similar.</p>

<p>Here are the totals for the numbers of lines of code in ICU 3.4.</p>
