/*
 * BOCU-1 encodes the code points of a Unicode string as
 * a sequence of byte-encoded differences (slope detection),
 * preserving lexical order.
 *
 * Optimize the difference-taking for runs of Unicode text within
 * small scripts:
 *
 * Most small scripts are allocated within aligned 128-blocks of Unicode
 * code points. Lexical order is preserved if the "previous code point" state
 * is always moved into the middle of such a block.
 *
 * Additionally, "prev" is moved from anywhere in the Unihan and Hangul
 * areas into the middle of those areas.
 *
 * C0 control codes and space are encoded with their US-ASCII bytes.
 * "prev" is reset for C0 controls but not for space.
