<p>Addition 2004-jul-22: <a href="#Native_Indexes">Native Indexes</a> and Issue
for chunk lifetime</p>
<h2>Problem Description and Goals</h2>
<p>ICU APIs operating on text accept either strings with contiguous storage of
UChars (UTF-16 code unit strings) or abstract APIs with per-character function
calls (iterators and Replaceable). This is not optimal when the native string
storage differs significantly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contiguous storage (UChar * or UnicodeString):<br>
    When text is stored in discontiguous chunks, then it needs to be reallocated
    and copied. This is very important when a large amount of text is to be
    processed, for example when searching for a pattern in a large text document
    stored inside a text editor or word processor etc.<br>
    When it is stored in a different encoding form (or not in Unicode), then it
    must be converted completely, although often only a small part of the text
    needs to be processed.</li>
  <li>Iterators &amp; Replaceable:<br>
    These incur per-character function call overhead which is significant for
    tight loops like in the break iteration code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to develop an abstract API for text access which can be used in
all relevant services and provide efficient access to text contents.</p>
<p>As a basic parameter, text continues to be mainly processed in the UTF-16
encoding form; while the API should allow for an implementation to convert other
kinds of text (especially UTF-8), this will not be particularly handled by the
API itself. <i>(But see the later idea for <a href="#Native_Indexes">Native
Indexes</a> below.)</i></p>
<h3>Types of Text</h3>
<p>The following types of text should be able to be handled efficiently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UChar * with length</li>
  <li>UChar * with NUL-termination</li>
  <li>UnicodeString (essentially the same as UChar * with length)</li>
  <li>Text stored in discontiguous chunks of UChars</li>
  <li>UTF-8 text (to a lesser degree)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Candidate Services</h3>
<p>We are looking at using the new API in the following service APIs and their
implementations, in roughly descending order of importance based on expected
usefulness:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Break iteration</li>
  <li>String search</li>
  <li>Regular expressions</li>
  <li>Collation (used by string search)</li>
  <li>Transforms (Transliterator API)</li>
  <li>Date/time/number etc. parsing (because a caller may not know the end of
    relevant text before parsing)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Text Access API</h2>
<p>The basic, abstract API for text access should have the following
characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimal, or nearly so</li>
  <li>For ICU4C: C API (struct), not C++, because it needs to work with other C
    APIs</li>
  <li>Read-only access</li>
  <li>Logically stateless (using const pointers in service APIs?), although some
    implementations must maintain state for efficiency</li>
  <li>Text is indexed using UChar (UTF-16 code unit) indexes as usual</li>
  <li>Logically, text starts at index 0, is contiguous, and has a length</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimum fields and methods:</p>
<pre>struct UTextAccessor {
    // or just call it UTextAccess? something else?

    int32_t size; /* =sizeof(UTextAccessor) for possible backward compatible extension */

    /* there should be a few int32_t and void * fields
     * like in UCharIterator to simplify implementations */

    /*
     * Returns the length of the text.
     * May be expensive to compute!
     * Not strictly minimally necessary, but needed for wrapping in existing
     * iterators and Replaceable.
     */
    int32_t length(const UTextAccessor *t);

    /*
     * Access to a chunk of text; signature needs to be fleshed out during prototyping.
     * Does not copy text but instead gives access to a portion of it.
     *
     * The intention is that for discontiguous storage the chunk would be an actual
     * storage block used for storing the text.
     * For contiguously stored text with known length, the whole text would be returned.
     * For NUL-terminated text, the implementation may scan forward in exponentially
     * larger chunks instead of finding the NUL right away.
     *
     * In: Text index; the returned chunk of text must contain the index.
     * Out:
     * - Pointer to chunk start
     * - Start and limit indexes corresponding to the chunk;
     *   it must be start&lt;=input index&lt;limit
     * - Indication of success: If the input index is negative or &gt;=length then
     *   failure needs to be indicated, probably by returning a NULL pointer
     */
    const UChar *access(const UTextAccessor *t, args);
    // or getChunk() or similar

    /*
     * Copy a chunk of text into a buffer.
     * Does it need a return value indicating success/failure?
     * The signature shown here is the same as in UReplaceable.
     * Not strictly minimally necessary; Replaceable has it.
     */
    void extract(const UTextAccessor *t,
                 int32_t start, int32_t limit, UChar *dest);
    // extract() is the method name in [U]Replaceable
};</pre>
<p><b>Replaceable/UReplaceable </b> need to be extended to have superset functionality
of UTextAccessor, so that services that use these for read/write operations can
take advantage of the faster per-chunk access for text matching. With the
current design, this means adding an access() function to [U]Replaceable. This
is an incompatible change; for C++ and Java, it may require a subclass
(sub-interface); for C, we could add a function pointer but would have to call
an existing function pointer to check for a newer implementation (e.g., check if
charAt(magic index)==magic value). (Careful when wrapping a Replaceable into a
UReplaceable to identify which of them is extended; may be safest to use
different means or different magic values.)</p>
<p><b>Issue for NUL-terminated strings</b>, which could be handled in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The UTextAccessor implementation handles NUL-termination. It needs to scan
    forward for each chunk access to limit the chunk by either the NUL or some
    size (which could be auto-adjustable).</li>
  <li>The user of UTextAccessor handles NUL-termination; the access() method
    would indicate if the limit is &quot;known good&quot; or if there may be a
    NUL in the chunk (it may require that there not be a NUL at or before the
    input index).<br>
    This speeds up and simplifies the UTextAccessor implementation but needs
    care on the user side. The wrappers proposed below would do this. It may
    make sense if the wrapper functions could combine the NUL check with the
    end-of-chunk check. With this, reading parts of the chunk before the
    known-for-now limit would be just as fast as with a known text length, and
    would not burden the UTextAccessor burden.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Issue for access() method signature: </b> Should it return a pointer and two
indexes, or two pointers, or...? Depends on most efficient wrapper code
determined during prototyping (although it is called only once per chunk, and so
redundant values could be calculated without much performance impact). For example:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
  <tr>
    <td>"Natural" signature; returns chunk start pointer or NULL if index is out of bounds
<pre>const UChar *access(
    const UTextAccessor *t,
    int32_t index,
    int32_t *pStart,
    int32_t *pLimit,
    UBool *pMayContainNUL);</pre></td>

    <td>Signature with minimum number of arguments; returns NULL pointer if
      index is out of bounds<pre>struct UTextAccessorChunk {
    const UChar *chunk;
    int32_t sizeOfThis;
    // =sizeof(UTextAccessorChunk)
    int32_t start, limit;
    UBool mayContainNUL;
};

// const?
TextAccessorChunk *access(
    const UTextAccessor *t,
    int32_t index);</pre></td>

    <td>Signature with small number of arguments but also avoids copying of returned values
      by using a fill-in; returns FALSE if index is out of bounds<pre>struct UTextAccessorChunk {
    const UChar *chunk;
    int32_t sizeOfThis;
    // =sizeof(UTextAccessorChunk)
    int32_t start, limit;
    UBool mayContainNUL;
};

UBool access(
    const UTextAccessor *t,
    int32_t index,
    UTextAccessorChunk *p);</pre></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>UTextAccessorChunk could also have a redundant const UChar *chunkLimit
      pointer;<br>
      it should have more UBool fields to avoid padding that may not be
      detectable with sizeof().</td>
    <td>UTextAccessorChunk could have the UTextAccessor pointer so that access()
      only has two arguments (index and p); seems clumsy-looking though.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><b>Issue for chunk lifetime: </b>It is probably necessary to assume that a
chunk is only valid until the next call to the access() method, to allow a
provider to reuse the buffer or change the text allocation. It might be useful
to be able to determine (see getType() below) if chunks have a longer lifetime,
until the text accessor is not used any more.</p>
<h2>Text Handling APIs for Service Implementations</h2>
<p>Service implementation code would normally not use the UTextAccessor API
directly, but with wrappers that use either C++ inline code (preferred) or
#define macros. (They would be final classes in Java.) Through inlining, the
code would gain access to the input text that is very efficient (because of
per-chunk function call amortization) and also convenient.</p>
<p>There are two wrappers envisioned, one for random access and one for
iteration. They could be merged into a single CharAccessor wrapper, given that
the random access wrapper only adds two functions and the setup and convenience
functions would overlap. (Slight problem: Semantics of mixing charAt() with
next() with regards to handling the current index.)</p>
<p>For maximum efficiency, the wrapper code should probably alias (not adopt)
the text accessor pointer, and should assume (instead of check) that the text
accessor pointer is set.</p>
<p>The wrapper classes could be internal, but are expected to be made public.</p>
<h3>Random Access Wrapper</h3>
<pre>class CharAccessor {
    // all-inline, and stack-allocatable
    // constructors, get/set UTextAccessor, etc.

    /*
     * Returns the UTF-16 code unit (UChar) at the requested index,
     * or U_SENTINEL (-1) if it is out of bounds.
     */
    inline UChar32 charAt(int32_t index);

    /*
     * Returns the code point at the requested index,
     * or U_SENTINEL (-1) if it is out of bounds.
     */
    inline UChar32 char32At(int32_t index);

    // convenience wrappers for length(), access(), extract()?
    // getChunkStart(), getChunkLimit() for the current chunk?
};</pre>
<h3>Iterator Wrapper</h3>
<pre>// careful not to clash with the different C API called UCharIterator
// different name? merge with CharAccessor?
class CharIterator {
    // all-inline, and stack-allocatable
    // constructors, get/set UTextAccessor, etc.
    // needs to have state besides the current chunk: at least the current index
    // for performance, may use a current-position pointer and chunk start/limit
    // pointers and translate back into indexes only when necessary

    // U_SENTINEL (-1) if out of bounds
    inline UChar32 next();
    inline UChar32 previous();

    // next32(), previous32()
    // set/get/move UChar index
    // set/get/move code point index

    // convenience wrappers for length(), access(), extract()?
    // getChunkStart(), getChunkLimit() for the current chunk?
};</pre>

<h2><a name="Native_Indexes" href="#Native_Indexes">Native Indexes</a></h2>
<p>Idea: Support UTF-8 and UTF-32 text (and other well-behaved codepages) with
native indexes into such text.</p>
<p>While ICU and much Unicode-aware software works on UTF-16 text internally,
some other Unicode software works with UTF-8/32, and text storage (in files,
databases and protocols) usually uses UTF-8 and other codepages. It is possible,
and necessary for efficient operation, to convert the text to one internal
format, but it would help efficiency and usefulness a lot if text indexes and
offsets were in terms of native text units. For example, a BreakIterator or
regular expression engine operating on UTF-8 text really needs to deliver UTF-8 indexes
in order to be useful, and index into the text using UTF-8 indexes to be
efficient.</p>
<p>Despite the possibility for support of native indexes, the API must present
the portions of text as chunks of UChars so that the inline wrappers work
efficiently (no virtual function calls!) and native UTF-16 text is handled in
the most efficient way.</p>
<p>It may not be necessary for the interesting service implementations (BreakIterator,
regex and such) to know <i>absolute </i>UTF-16 indexes (counting from the
beginning of the text) at all. Of course, next() and next32() would work on a
chunk of UChars and thus move in UChar and code point intervals, but it may be
sufficient to only operate on native indexes in getIndex() and setIndex(). This
would make text provider implementations much more efficient when absolute
UTF-16 indexes are not trivial and efficient to compute.</p>
<p>Some code may require UTF-16 indexes and should have a way to test on the
text access API if the provider uses UTF-16 or native indexes. See the getType()
method proposal below.</p>
<p>The main decision to be made is whether a modified API which can handle
native indexes is worth the effort, weighing the implementation effort (and
performance decrease for actual UTF-16 text, if such a decrease could not be
avoided) against the benefit of handling non-UTF-16 text well, especially
UTF-8/32.</p>
<h3>Index Semantics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most indexes on the API would be &quot;native&quot; indexes. They would be
    UTF-16 indexes when that is the actual underlying storage and when native
    indexes correspond 1:1 to UTF-16 indexes (e.g., for most single-byte codepages, ASCII portions of
    UTF-8 text, and BMP portions of UTF-32 text).</li>
  <li>The result of calling access() would indicate whether indexes related to
    the chunk are &quot;native&quot; (need translation) or in terms of UTF-16.</li>
  <li>Logically, text starts at index 0, is contiguous, and has a (native) length.</li>
  <li>Indexes probably need to be monotonous, i.e., no reordering.</li>
  <li>Indexes may not need to be contiguous, i.e., there may be
    index-unreachable parts of the native storage (e.g., for SI/SO controls in
    stateful text).</li>
  <li>Indexes are only valid on index-translatable boundaries, and chunks need
    to start and end on such boundaries. (No need to require code point
    boundaries. This allows for chunks starting and
    ending in the middle of a surrogate pair for UTF-16, SCSU, CESU-8,
    simplifying buffer handling.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impact on Text Access API</h3>
<p><b>access() </b>method: Probably best with a fill-in struct and returning a
boolean value like the third option above. It would need additional output
parameters because the chunk length would not correspond to (limitIndex-startIndex)
any more, and because translating chunk positions into native indexes, including
finding the UChar chunk position corresponding to the requestIndex, would not be
trivial. If no index map is provided, then the chunk positions correspond 1:1 to
native indexes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In:
    <ul>
      <li>int32_t requestIndex: Requested index to be in the returned chunk</li>
      <li>pointer to fill-in struct for all output values except the boolean
        &quot;ok/failure&quot;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Out:
    <ul>
      <li>Boolean &quot;ok/failure&quot; as above</li>
      <li>int32_t startIndex (native)</li>
      <li>int32_t limitIndex (native)</li>
      <li>const UChar *chunkPtr</li>
      <li>int32_t index16 (UChar index into the chunk; relative to chunkPtr and
        corresponding to requestIndex)</li>
      <li>int32_t chunkLength16 (number of UChars at chunkPtr)</li>
      <li>const int32_t *indexMap (has chunkLength16+1 entries mapping chunk
        positions to native indexes)<br>
        (if NULL, then chunk positions correspond 1:1 to native indexes; see
        issue discussion below)</li>
      <li>int32_t startIndex16 (startIndex translated into an absolute UTF-16
        index)<br>
        (not sure this is necessary, see section introduction above; should be
        allowed to be set to &lt;0 for &quot;don't know&quot;)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: There is redundant information. If an index map is used, then
startIndex=indexMap[0] and limitIndex=indexMap[chunkLength16]. If an index map
is not used, then index16=requestIndex-startIndex.</p>

<p><b>Issue for 1:1 indexes: </b>It should be allowed to use an index map only
some of the time, to operate faster on portions of the text where an index map
is not necessary. The API could have one of two semantics: <b>a) </b>If
no index map is provided, then all indexes returned by access() would be
interpreted as UTF-16 indexes; this would work only for <i>initial </i>ASCII
portions of UTF-8, for example. <b>b) </b>If no index map is provided, then the
chunk positions correspond 1:1 to native indexes (chunkLength16=(limitIndex-startIndex),
index16=(requestIndex-startIndex) etc.) but the absolute indexes may not
correspond 1:1 (i.e., the native startIndex need not be the same as the
corresponding UTF-16 index); this would allow to handle any initial <i>or
intermediate </i>ASCII portion of UTF-8 or BMP portion of UTF-32 without an
index map.</p>

<p>Option b) may really help efficiency when there are few non-ASCII characters
in UTF-8 text or few supplementary ones in UTF-32. On the other hand, for UTF-32
this may not matter much since supplementary characters may be so rare that
option a) would work almost as well. (Non-ASCII text in UTF-8 is of course very
common.)</p>

<p><b>Issue for index map contents: </b>We probably need to have valid indexes
in every position of the indexMap. Should the indexes in there be chunk-relative
(like in the ICU converter API) or should they be absolute native indexes? The
former would mesh more easily with ICU converters but require an addition of the
startIndex to get an absolute index; the latter would be a little easier to use.</p>

<p><b>Issue for setIndex() (including charAt() etc.): </b>As proposed above, the
indexMap would very efficiently support getIndex() operations &mdash; the index would
simply be looked up in the indexMap, using the current chunk position. Without a
reverse index map, setIndex() (and charAt() etc.) would be more expensive, requiring a
linear or binary search of the indexMap to find the corresponding chunk
position. (Relatively fast for short chunks.) With a reverse index map, setIndex()
would be cheap and the above-proposed index16 output parameter
for the access() method could be removed, but the access() method implementation
would have to do more work and provide yet another buffer (which would have a different length:
(limitIndex-startIndex+1)).</p>

<p>It is expected that getIndex() may be used often, especially in regular
expressions, while setIndex() may be used relatively less often. Options: a)
Leave proposal as is. b) Add a reverse index map. c) Add a method that
translates an index (between the current chunk's startIndex and limitIndex) into
the chunk position. d) Assume that even getIndex() will be rare and handle it
with another method.</p>

<h3>Other Text Access API Methods</h3>

<p><b>length() </b>method: Return length in native units. Needs to be renamed to
lengthEx() or similar because of semantic collision with Replaceable.length().</p>

<p><b>extract() </b>method: Needs more parameters because the number of
extracted UChars is not the same as (limit-start) any more. Therefore, it also
becomes incompatible with Replaceable.extract() and should be renamed extractEx()
or similar.</p>

<p>Probable signature: int32_t extractEx([this, ] int32_t start<sub>native</sub>,
int32_t limit<sub>native</sub>, UChar *dest, int32_t destCapacity) returning the
actual number of UChars which may exceed destCapacity (preflighting). Return 0
if there are no UChars to extract.</p>

<p><b>getType() </b>method - new proposal: We probably need a function returning
a bit set (uint32_t) for &quot;unusual&quot; features of the text provider.
There should be flags for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Default: all bits 0</li>
  <li>Uses non-UTF-16 indexes (allow a user of UTextAccessor to reject such text
    if the implementation can't handle it)</li>
  <li>Absolute UTF-16 indexes not available (if access() has a startIndex16
    output parameter; in this case, startIndex16 may be set to -1)</li>
  <li>The length() method is [in]expensive (not sure how to make use of this,
    but easy to return as a bit flag)</li>
  <li>Chunks returned by the access() method stay valid as long as the text
    object is used (read-only, not when using replace() or copy() on
    Replaceable), as opposed to chunks becoming invalidated when access() is
    called again</li>
</ul>
<h3>Native Indexes vs. Replaceable</h3>

<p>Without native indexes, the text access API overlaps with Replaceable; only
the access() function needs to be added to Replaceable to make it a superset.
There are compatibility issues with extending the API, see above.</p>

<p>With native indexes, the desired semantics and method signatures differ from
those of Replaceable. The existing Replaceable methods need to continue to work
with UTF-16 indexes. Native-index versions of the replace() and maybe copy()
methods need to be added. Text providers implementing both UTF-16 and native
index semantics are more complicated.</p>

<p>(In addition to taking native indexes, replace() would probably have to
return by how much the limit index changes as a result of the text replacement,
so that the API user can adjust higher indexes and continue to operate on the
text. This number is not predictable from the number of UChars and may not be
the same as (limit-start) when such text was extracted from somewhere else if
the native text has a stateful encoding.)</p>

<p>Note for existing users of Replaceable: If setIndex() is not trivial/cheap
(see issue above), then a good implementation would need to try to avoid using
charAt() and char32At() and rather favor iteration-style wrapper methods like
current() and next().</p>

<p>There are two options for Replaceable:</p>

<p>Replaceable could get more functions as necessary. Advantage: No change to
the signature of existing APIs like Transliterator. Disadvantage: Mixing
semantics in one API. Also, most of the work to make sure an implementation can
handle native indexes is probably in the implementation, rather than in adding
overloads using a new text API.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a clean new API (e.g., ReplaceableEx) could be introduced with
only the new methods. It would remove charAt() and char32At() (which are now
done by the wrapper class). It would eliminate the question of how to extend the
old [U]Replaceable APIs. It would avoid mixing semantics and forcing
native-index implementations to also implement the older UTF-16-index-only
methods. It would require new overloads to APIs that now use Replaceable, if and
when their implementation can handle native indexes. Some methods (e.g.,
length()) may still want to be renamed to avoid collision and confusion with
common names or with old Replaceable names in classes implementing both
interfaces.</p>
