#Agenda for today's meeting#

1. Uncompleted action item from the previous meetings:
    - Basis will send the name list to IBM - still in progress (Karen is working on that.)
    - Tom (Basis) and Alan (IBM) will contact each other regarding transliteration framework issues. - in progress
    - Markus will finish updating the ICU coding standards and contribution process document to clearly specify the boot strapping mechanism and C/C++ interface design goals. -- in progress

    - Bob will investigate the native C interface dependency on C++.  -- in progress
        Currently, the C++ dependencies still exist in ICU's C interface.  For example, Locale::getDataDirectory(), ResourceBundle.  Bob suggested that ICU C interface be separated into its own library and the true C tests be compiled and linked with C compiler.

2. Requirement list review
The following additional requirements are suggested to be added to the list:

    - Add the sort key compressing mechanism. (Steve W.)
    - Review converter alias references.  (Tex T.)
    - Abstract mail message interface.  (Hideki H.)
    - w3C character model.  (Markus S.)
    - DLL-fying binary data segments on Win32.  (Bob V. proposed, Steven L. owns)

Helena proposed to review the priorities of the requirement list in the next meeting.  Tex also suggested that the prioritization can be done by categories.  For example, basic level support vs. high level support.  Bob mentioned that the OS dependency abstraction interface is very important to Compuware and has volunteer to share with us his design document regarding this.  The above requirements are owned by the originator unless specified.
