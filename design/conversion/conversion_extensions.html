<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There are often several Unicode conversion tables per charset.</li>
  <li>Ideally, ICU would support as many of them out of the box as possible.</li>
  <li>Out of the box, ICU already supports &gt;200 conversion tables, taking up 
    more than half of its 8MB data.
    There are hundreds more conversion tables in the <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/charts/charset/">ICU 
    charset repository</a>.</li>
  <li>ICU's data structures (.ucm source files and .cnv binaries) do not  
    currently support conversion of multiple characters/code points at once. For  
    some legacy and some newer charsets, such many-to-one mappings are required. 
    <ul>
      <li>JIS X 0213 maps some JIS characters to multiple Unicode code points  
        (including combining enclosing marks). Future CJK conversion tables are 
        expected to map some characters to Unicode code point sequences 
        including variation selectors.</li>
      <li>MacOS maps some Unicode code points to multiple charset characters 
        according to their canonical or compatibility decompositions (e.g., 
        Unicode ff ligature to 2 'f's).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<h3>Converter + Transliterator</h3>
<p>A long-standing idea is to combine ICU conversion with ICU 
transforms/transliteration. The Transliterator service is very flexible and 
handles m:n mappings between sequences of Unicode code points. The ICU converter 
would be customized to map to/from special (PUA) code points matching the 
transliterator/transform rules.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Combination of existing APIs.</li>
  <li>Handling of complex transformations like Arabic shaping or Indic syllable 
    transformation.</li>
  <li>Possibly even BiDi reordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The combination of a converter and a transliterator would probably require 
    a different API than the regular conversion API, which limits the use of the 
    new API to new application code taking advantage of it.</li>
  <li>Offsets would probably not be able to be provided.</li>
  <li>Complex cases would probably require chunking of input text into lines or 
    paragraphs.</li>
</ul>

(originally 618, but that was mistakenly used to commit changes for a different 
bug)</p>
<h3>Converter Extension</h3>
<p>The obvious alternative is to extend the conversion data structures to 
support more of what ICU users need. Such an extension would be designed to work 
within the existing conversion API, which would be immediately enabled for all 
applications that upgrade to a newer ICU release. While more complex 
transformations would not be designed into such extensions, m:n mappings should 
be possible and offsets should be able to be provided.</p>
<p>If we could combine multiple .cnv files into one, then we could save space 
while increasing the set of supported charsets.</p>
<p>Jitterbug: <a href="http://www.jtcsv.com/cgibin/icu-bugs?findid=2404">2404</a></p>
<p>The section below contains ideas for binary data structures.</p>
<h2>Extension Tables</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to handle most mappings via the existing state table (to 
Unicode) and trie (from Unicode). When an unmappable result or a special, new 
marker is found, then an additional table is searched. A new marker in a 
fromUnicode table could be a result byte sequence with a trailing 00 byte, for 
example. Using a special marker would avoid slowing down processing of 
unmappable characters, which might be common when output-escaping XML.</p>
<p>An extension table need not be designed for highest performance if its mappings  
are rarely used. The most compact would be to store a list of pairs of (Unicode  
code units, charset bytes) where the unit/byte sequences are of variable length.  
Variable length entries are required for multiple-character mappings.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, searching the extension data must not be outrageously slow 
(as it would be with linear searches on thousands of entries), or else total 
conversion performance will be unacceptable. It seems that, at a minimum, there 
would have to be data structures for each direction (to/from Unicode) that allow 
at least a binary search.</p>
<p>Reasonable performance of extension lookups is especially important when the 
base table does not have special markers for extension mappings.</p>
<p>For ideas about data structures for conversion extension data see <a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icuhtml/trunk/design/conversion/ucnv_ext.h">ucnv_ext.h</a> 
and <a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icuhtml/trunk/design/conversion/ucnv_ext.c">ucnv_ext.c</a> 
in this same design folder (<a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icuhtml/trunk/design/conversion/">icuhtml/design/conversion</a>).</p>
<h3>Multiple Extension Tables per File</h3> 
<p>A single .cnv file may contain multiple such data structures, one per   
conversion table variant. A Shift-JIS .cnv table would use the regular state   
table + trie for all common mappings and one extension data structure per   
variant. Only one variant would be active for a particular converter. A basic  
requirement is that the state tables of all variants must be identical (at least  
for the set of legal byte sequences).</p> 
<p>The  
canonical names of (or some other IDs for) the variants would probably need to  
be stored with the extensions for selection, and the alias table would have to  
select the common .cnv file with an option for the variant name/ID. It would be  
most convenient if makeconv could take multiple .ucm files and automatically  
generate a combined .cnv file. Real canonical names stored in the .cnv file 
would be easiest to automate and best for ucnv_getName() returning a const char 
*.</p>

<h3>Single Extension Tables per File (preferred approach)</h3>
<p>Alternatively, one .cnv file may contain at most one extension data 
structure. Multiple extension files would refer by name to the base table. 
Variants could be added much more easily than if all are stored in a single file 
because an additional variant just requires one more .cnv file. Multiple 
Shif-JIS variants would refer to the same sjisbase.cnv which itself would not be 
listed as an available converter.</p>
<p>It may be useful to allow one extension data structure in a regular .cnv file 
so that conversion tables with complex mappings need not be split into 
base+extension files.</p>
<p>Using separate files for base and extension requires the base to not contain 
mappings for anything that any of the extensions covers. This is not too hard 
with a conservative set of mappings for the base (although a conservative base 
set increases the size of extensions), but it makes it very difficult to use a 
special extension marker in the base table. In this case it may be necessary to 
always check the extension table when an input sequence is legal but unmappable.</p>
<p>The alias table would be very simple: One regular canonical name per variant, 
without any options syntax. The extension .cnv file would contain the associated 
base table's canonical name.</p>
<p>The makeconv tool would also be simpler than with multiple variants per .cnv  
file. Initially it could just read the .ucm source for the extension and  
generate a .cnv file with a new internal format. Eventually it should read the  
base .ucm or .cnv file as well and verify that the base does not contain  
conflicting mappings, as well as verifying that the charset byte sequences are  
legal. It would never have to read all variants at once.</p> 
<p>To simplify .ucm file maintenance, makeconv should accept complete conversion  
tables for extensions, including the base mappings, and simply omit the base 
mappings when writing the extension table . This of course requires that makeconv read the base table along with  
the extension .ucm file. Otherwise one would have to slice the extension part  
off the base mappings manually or with a separate tool.</p> 
<h3> Conversion Data Size</h3>
<p>In order to be useful for handling both table variants and m:n mappings well, 
there will - as usual - be a compromise between size and lookup speed for the 
extension data structure. Still, there will be far fewer mappings in a variant 
extension table than in a complete conversion table, so several variants will 
use less memory and disk space than a second full table file. Extension tables 
will allow ICU to improve the set of conversion tables while reducing their 
total size.</p>
