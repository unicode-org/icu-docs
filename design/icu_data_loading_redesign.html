<h1>ICU Data Loading Redesign</h1>
<p align="right">Markus Scherer, San José 2002-feb-05</p>
<p>Result of a meeting of the IBM San José ICU team with Yves Arrouye,
RealNames, on 2002-jan-30 at IBM San José. Summary by Markus, followed by <a href="#yves_minutes">minutes
by Yves</a>.</p>
<p>Also <a href="#available_open">below</a>: Meeting minutes of a meeting among
members of the IBM ICU team about, among other things, consistency of
uxyz_getAvailable() vs. uxyz_open().</p>
<h2>Basics &amp; Terminology</h2>
<p>Much of this has been around since ICU 1.4, although we made changes for 1.5
and 2.0. Please see the <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/userguide/icudata.html">ICU
Data</a> chapter in the <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/userguide/">User's
Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The general assumption is that data for both ICU and for ICU applications is
packaged into &quot;common data files&quot; with Tables of Contents, in the form
of either DLLs or .dat files.</p>
<p>Additional data may be supplied in per-data-piece files, up to the extent
that there is no &quot;common&quot; file at all, or only an empty one.</p>
<p>An important item on the API is what we used to call the &quot;basename&quot;:
The package name, used as a filename for DLL or .dat, or optionally as a prefix
for single files. The first argument in functions like udata_open() or ures_open()
is a path/basename string. This string is taken apart into the path and the
basename, split at the last separator ('/' or '\' on most platforms).</p>
<p>The udata service caches common data files but not single-data-piece files.
However, Individual data (whereever found) is cached in other services like
resource bundles (ures), collation (ucol), etc.</p>
<p>On the API, the path/basename argument is always NULL for ICU. The
implementation uses the implicit search path (from ICU_DATA/u_setDataDirectory())
and the ICU data basename (like &quot;icudt20b&quot;).</p>
<h2>Problems with ICU 2.0 data loading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Too many ways to find and load data</li>
  <li>Very few people understand how it works</li>
  <li>Extensibility is limited because data is found first in a
    &quot;common&quot; file, so that a separate (newer) data piece file cannot
    override the packaged data &mdash; we did this for performance</li>
  <li>Confusing interaction of the ICU_DATA folder setting with application
    data, especially when using &quot;files mode&quot; (ICU data in separate
    files, not packaged into a &quot;common&quot; file)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consensus for post-2.0 data loading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There should be one search path for both ICU's and ICU application's data,
    with 0 or more folders listed</li>
  <li>In terms of finding data, a path is specified if there is a non-empty path
    in the data loading arguments, or if the search path is not empty.</li>
  <li>ICU will <i>only </i>look in a common file if <i>no </i>path or no
    basename is specified.</li>
  <li>ICU will look for single-data-piece files <i>before </i>common/package
    files, but only if a path and a basename are specified. This allows maximum performance by
    not specifying a path.</li>
  <li>Single-data files will always have a prefix that is the same as the &quot;basename&quot;
    (package name). This roughly mirrors Java RB filenames.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Pseudo-code:</p>
<pre>
global variable: searchPath
    set with ICU_DATA and/or u_setDataDirectory()

global variable: cache/registry of common files, associates string (path/basename) with data pointer
    can be set with udata_setCommonData() for ICU
    can be set with udata_setAppData() for application data
    otherwise self-registering while loading, see below

udata_open(path_basename, name, type) { // all arguments are char* strings; type=&quot;res&quot; for RBs
    search for last '/' in path_basename, split into path and basename

    // look for single-data-piece file
    if(path not empty) {
        look for single file &quot;path/basename_name.type&quot;
        return it if found, else go on
    } else if(searchPath has at least one path) {
        for each path in searchPath {
            look for single file &quot;path/basename_name.type&quot;
            return it if found, else continue loop
        }
    }

    // look for common/packaged file, cache first
    if(path_basename in cache/registry of common files) {
        common=get from cache
    } else if(path not empty) {
        look for memory-mappable common file &quot;path/basename.dat&quot;
        set common if found
        if found, also add (&quot;path/basename&quot;, common) to cache/registry
    } else if(searchPath has at least one path) {
        for each path in searchPath {
            look for memory-mappable common file &quot;path/basename.dat&quot;
            set common if found and break, else continue loop
            if found, also add (&quot;path/basename&quot;, common) to cache/registry
        }
    }

    // look in the common file
    if(common!=none) {
        search common.ToC for &quot;name.type&quot;
        return it if found, else go on
    }

    return not_found
}
</pre>
<h2>Issues with this consensus</h2>
<p>Vladimir brought up the following bootstrapping problem: At ICU build time,
we do not have a common data file yet. Single ICU data files must be built with
the &quot;basename_&quot; prefix. The package name would be
&quot;icudt20b&quot;; a single-data filename would be
&quot;icudt20b_fr_BE.res&quot;; currently, icudt20b.dat contains a ToC entry of
&quot;fr_BE.res&quot;.<br>
If we continue to not have the &quot;basename_&quot; prefix in the ToC in the
packaged/common file, then the packaging must be made smart enough to remove the
&quot;basename_&quot;. This should not be too hard.<br>
Alternatively, we could keep the &quot;basename_&quot; in the ToC, which means
that all files in a common file have the same such prefix, which is the same as
the package name. Wastes a little bit of space.</p>
<p>Always building with the &quot;basename_&quot; prefix means that we probably
need to have a basename command line option for all build tools to avoid
changing all of the source filenames; changing the source filenames would
actually not work because the ICU data basename contains the ICU version number
and the platform endianness/charset family.</p>
<p>Filename length restrictions: We should keep all filenames, including for
runtime data files that have the &quot;basename_&quot; prefix (9 characters), at
&lt;=31 characters to not break MacOS more than necessary (and for sanity). This
leaves 22 characters not counting the prefix, meaning that source filenames
should typically not be longer than 22 characters.</p>
<h2>Enumerating data pieces</h2>
<p>We are thinking about enumerating ICU data pieces like locale data RBs,
transliterator RBs, etc. In an <a href="#available_open"> IBM ICU-only meeting on
2002-feb-04</a>, we decided
to keep filenames distinguishable. RBs with &quot;t_...&quot; will be used for
transliterators. RBs with locale data will not have &quot;(single
letter)_&quot;. Future non-locale data RBs will have filenames that start with a
single letter, followed by an underscore.</p>

<p>(Email from Yves Arrouye, RealNames, from 2002-jan-30)</p>
<pre>
Thanks for having me. It was interesting and fruitful.

Here's my recap of things.

Goal: design a way to load any kind of ICU-consumed data (resource bundles,
converters, collators, etc..., being packaged or not) that is easy to
understand, simple, and cover the following scenarios:

Scenario 1: An application loads ICU data as well as its own data from the
ICU data directory to which it has access.

Scenario 2: An application loads ICU data from the read-only ICU data
directory, as well as its own data from its own location(s).

Scenario 3: An application provides in its own location(s) some data that
needs to take precedence over the ICU data located in the ICU data
directory. An example is an application wanting to keep ICU's root and fr_BE
locales, but providing its own fr locale.

We took the ures_open() call as the work example. ures_open() is called as
ures_open(name, locale).

After some (much) discussion, we agreed on the following idea:

- As far as data loading goes, there is no difference between ICU owned data
and application data. They both are data that ICU can manipulate, and
treating them separately is hurting more than helping, making interfaces
more complex and confusing.

- The ICU data directory will be turned into a search path that may contain
many directories. This means that applications can simply add to that search
path in order to change where the data are loaded from. For instance, in the
case of scenario 3, the application can simply prepend its own data
directory to the path as well as supply an fr locale to have it found and
shadow the ICU one, which would be found later in the path. Scenario 1 is
covered with the path being simply the ICU data directory, and Scenario 2 is
covered by having the application add its own directory, with the added
flexibility of being able to choose whether it wants to be in front or
behind ICU.

- (We haven't said it but I think it's implicit). The path will have the
syntax of paths on the platform. For instance, they'll be separated by
semicolons on Windows, colons on UNIX, etc...

- ICU will continue to look for individual files as well as packaged data.
This means that the call ures_open(&quot;mydata&quot;, &quot;fr_BE&quot;) will look for a file
named mydata_fr_BE.res or one called mydata.dat that contains an fr_BE
locale. It will also do so in that order, and for each component of the
path. If the first argument is an absolute path, however, that path, and
only that path, will be used for the search.

- Applications that never want the filesystem to be touched will be able to
link against their data, and set the ICU data path to 0 (or NULL for those
who haven't been bitten by NULL yet).

- There is a single cache mapping parameters passed to ures_open() to chunks
of memory (loaded data). That cache is checked first before looking into the
search path (meaning that if the search path is 0, the cache is still
checked). When one register application data (setAppData()) the cache is
filled, so it also serves as a registry in this way. The keys in the cache
are made of a combination of the arguments passed to ures_open().

The following algorithm illustrates the new functionality in
pseudo-whatever:

resource *ures_open(const char *tag, const char *loc) {
    resource *res = ures_checkcache(tag, loc);  /* look in cache */
    if (!res) {
       /* try_load() gets a path w/o extension, and a locale,
          and returns 0 if cannot find the resource, or the res
          if it found it, in which case the cache is updated. */

       if (is_absolute_path(tag)) {
		      res = try_load(tag, tag, loc);
       } else {
		      foreach dir in search_path() {
		          if (!(res = try_load(dir, tag + &quot;_&quot; + loc, loc))) {
		 		        if (res = try_load(dir, tag, loc)) {
                       break;
                   }
               }
           }
		  }
    }
    return res;
}

(and since I don't read myself again I may have missed something. But it
*has* to look simple because it *is* simple).

Issues that we haven't discussed, because they are minor:

- What happens if there is a mydata_fr_BE.res file that does not contain an
fr_BE locale. Should ICU continue to look for something, or bail out with an
error? (I assumed the former in the above pseudo code.)

- I personally think that we should keep the name ICU_DATA and let people
make it a path. Not much to gain by forcing them to change the variable
name.

- It would be nice to deprecate u_setDataDirectory() and
u_getDataDirectory() and rename them u_setDataSearchPath() and
u_getDataSearchPath() or something. Now, while they are being deprecated, I
think it is fair to make u_setDataDirectory() an alias to
u_setDataSearchPath(), but that it would also be desirable to keep
u_getDataDirectory()'s behavior to return $ICU_DATA if it is a single
directory, otherwise the place where the ICU data was found in the search
path (or the compile time default if it was linked in). That will make
existing applications that dump stuff in the ICU data and then call
u_getDataDirectory() to refer back to it, still work.

- If you do not want to have this data loading opening handle endianness by
naming convention (by appending something) then I think that we need to
clearly document a preferred naming convention so that one's &quot;mem&quot; bundle,
once transformed into &quot;meme.res&quot; for endianness, does not conflict with my
&quot;meme&quot; bundle for which I forgot about setting the endianness. That is why
it would be nice to have the tools and the data loading do that
automatically for you. But that's minor.

- When applications set the path, they can decide whether to be in front of
behind the previous path. So my application could ship, say, with a
converter, but put its directory *after* the existing path to indicate that
I'd rather use the official ICU one if it exists (say in a later version)
than my own one. Now, when applications link and call setAppData(), they put
the name in the cache, and then there is no search done. I do not know if
it's worth giving them the same flexibility there. (If all they care about
is a before/after relationship, then they should either setAppData()
immediately to be before, or first ures_open() and only setAppData() after
it fails to be after. I think that covers 99% of the cases.)

Again, it was nice to brainstorm with all of you. I'll do that again anytime
you want with great pleasure.
