<h1>Petrifiable</h1>
<p>2005-09-07 MED</p>
<p>The following is a proposal to add a new interface to Java, and add the corresponding mixin to 
C++, and implement this new interface in UnicodeSet.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><b>Issue: </b>we've tossed around a couple of different names for this: Freezable, Bakeable, 
  Lockable are other contenders. Lockable seems too easily confused with mutex locking. Bakeable may 
  be too whimsical. Freezable may lead someone to think that you can unfreeze (when you can never do 
  that).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>There are often times when you need objects to be objects 'safe', so that they can't be modified. 
Examples are when objects need to be thread-safe, or in writing robust code, or in caches. If you 
are only creating your own objects, you can guarantee this, of course -- but only if you don't make 
a mistake. If you have objects handed into you, or are creating objects using others handed into 
you, it is a different story.</p>
<p>It all comes down to whether you want to take the Blanche Dubois approach (&quot;depend on the 
kindness of strangers&quot;) or the Andy Grove approach (&quot;Only the Paranoid Survive&quot;).</p>
<p>(The following is written in terms of Java, but can be applied to C and C++, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.)</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a simple class:</p>
<pre>public class A {
    protected Collection b;
    protected Collection c;
    public Collection get_b() {
        return b;
    }
    public Collection get_c() {
        return c;
    }
    public A(Collection new_b, Collection new_c) {
        b = new_b;
        c = new_c;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Since the class doesn't have any setters, someone might think that it is immutable. You know 
where this is leading, of course; this class is unsafe in a number of ways. The following 
illustrates that.</p>
<pre>public test1(SupposedlyImmutableClass x, SafeStorage y) {
<font color="#0000FF">    <b>// unsafe getter</b>
</font>    A a = x.getA();
    Collection col = a.get_b();
    col.add(something);<font color="#0000FF"> // a has now been changed, and x too
</font>
    <font color="#0000FF"><b>// unsafe constructor</b></font>
    a = new A(col, col);
    y.store(a);
    col.add(something);<font color="#0000FF"> // a has now been changed, and y too
</font>}</pre>
<p>There are a few different techniques for having safe classes.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Const objects. In C++, you can declare parameters const.</li>
  <li>Immutable wrappers. For example, you can put a collection in an immutable wrapper.</li>
  <li>Always-Immutable objects. Java uses this approach, with a few variations. Examples:<ol>
    <li>Simple. Once a Color is created (eg from R, G, and B integers) it is immutable.</li>
    <li>Builder Class. There is a separate 'builder' class. For example, modifiable Strings are 
    created using StringBuffer (which doesn't have the full String API available). Once you want an 
    immutable form, you create one with toString().</li>
    <li>Primitives. These are always safe, since they are copied on input/output from methods.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Cloning. Where you need an object to be safe, you clone it.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages of each of these.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Const provides a certain level of protection, but since const can be and is often cast away, 
  it only protects against most inadvertent mistakes. It also offers no threading protection, since 
  anyone who has a pointer to the (unconst) object in another thread can mess you up.</li>
  <li>Immutable wrappers are safer than const in that the constness can't be cast away. But other 
  than that they have all the same problems: not safe if someone else keeps hold of the original 
  object, or if any of the objects returned by the class are mutable.</li>
  <li>Always-Immutable Objects are safe, but usage can require excessive object creation.</li>
  <li>Cloning is only safe if the object truly has a 'safe' clone; defined as one that <i>ensures 
  that no change to the clone affects the original</i>. Unfortunately, many objects don't have a 
  'safe' clone, and always cloning can require excessive object creation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Petrifiable Model</h2>
<p>An alternative model is the <code>Petrifiable</code> model. With this, you can build up an object 
by calling various methods, then when it is in a final state, you can <i>make</i> it immutable. Once 
immutable, an object cannot <i>ever </i>be modified, and is completely thread-safe: that is, 
multiple threads can have references to it without any synchronization.</p>
<p>Here is the interface:</p>
<pre>public interface Petrifiable implements Cloneable {
    public boolean isImmutable();
    public Object makeImmutable();
    public Object clone();
}</pre>
<p>If someone needs a mutable version of an object, they can use <code>clone()</code>, and modify 
the copy. This provides a simple, effective mechanism for safe classes in circumstances where the 
alternatives are insufficient or clumsy.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b>a flaw in Java is that implementing <code>Cloneable</code> doesn't give you a
  <code>clone()</code> method!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If an object is shared before it is immutable, then it is the responsibility of each thread to 
mutex its usage (as with other objects).</p>
<p>Here is what needs to be done to implement this interface, depending on the type of the object.</p>
<h3><b>Immutable Objects</b></h3>
<p>These are the easiest. You just use the interface to reflect that, by adding the following:</p>
<pre>public class A implements Petrifiable {
...
    public final boolean isImmutable() {return true;}
    public final Object makeImmutable() {return this;}
    public final Object clone() { return this; }
}</pre>
<p>These can be final methods because subclasses of immutable objects must themselves be immutable. 
(Note: <code>makeImmutable</code> is returning <code>this</code> for chaining; if the class doesn't 
follow that pattern, then void would be returned.)</p>
<h3><b>Mutable Objects</b></h3>
<p>Add a protected 'flagging' field:</p>
<pre>    protected boolean immutable;</pre>
<p>Add the following methods:</p>
<pre>    public final boolean isImmutable() {return immutable;};

    public Object makeImmutable() {immutable = true; return this;}</pre>
<p>Add a <code>clone()</code> method following the normal pattern, except that <code>immutable=false</code> 
in the new clone.</p>
<p>Then take the setters (that is, any method that can change the internal state of the object), and 
add the following as the first statement:</p>
<pre>    if (isImmutable()) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;Attempt to modify immutable object&quot;);
    }</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b>In C/C++, the corresponding change is to set the
  <a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net/userguide/design.html#Error_Handling">error code parameter</a> 
  and return. If through some oversight the setters don't currently have that parameter, then those 
  APIs will silently fail; depending on the case in question, new APIs can be added that do have the 
  error code parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><b>Subclassing</b></h4>
<p>Any subclass of a <code>Petrifiable</code> will just use its superclass's flagging field. It must 
override <code>makeImmutable()</code> and <code>clone()</code> to call the superclass, but normally 
does not override <code>isImmutable()</code>. It must then just pay attention to its own getters, 
setters and fields.</p>
<h4><b>Internal Caches</b></h4>
<p>Internal caches are cases where the object is logically unmodified, but internal state of the 
object changes. For example, there are const C++ functions that cast away the const on the &quot;this&quot; 
pointer in order to modify an object cache. These cases are handled by mutexing the internal cache 
to ensure thread-safety. For example, suppose that UnicodeSet had an internal marker to the last 
code point accessed. In this case, the field is not externally visible, so the only thing you need 
to do is to synchronize the field for thread safety.</p>
<h4>Unsafe Internal Access</h4>
<p>Internal fields are called <i>safe</i> if they are either <code>Petrifiable</code> or immutable 
(such as String or primitives). If you've never allowed internal access to these, then you are all 
done. For example, converting UnicodeSet to be <code>Petrifiable</code> is just accomplished with 
the above steps. But remember that you <i><b>have</b></i> allowed access to unsafe internals if you 
have any code like the following, in a getter, setter, or constructor:</p>
<pre>    Collection getStuff() {return stuff;} // caller could keep reference &amp; modify
    void setStuff(Collection x) {stuff = x;} // caller could keep reference &amp; modify
    MyClass(Collection x) {stuff = x;} // caller could keep reference &amp; modify</pre>
<p>These also illustrated in the code sample in <b>Background</b> above.</p>
<p>To deal with unsafe internals, the simplest course of action is to do the work in the <code>
makeImmutable()</code> function. Just make all of your internal fields immutable, and set the 
immutable flag. Any subsequent getter/setter will work properly. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>    public Object makeImmutable() {
        if (!immutable) {
            foo.makeImmutable();
            immutable = true;
        }
        return this;
    }</pre>
<p>If the field is a <code>Collection</code> or <code>Map</code>, then to make it immutable you have 
two choices. If you have never allowed access to the collection from outside your object, then just 
wrap it to prevent future modification.</p>
<pre>     zone_to_country = Collections.unmodifiableMap(zone_to_country);</pre>
<p>If you have <i>ever</i> allowed access, then do a <code>clone()</code> before wrapping it.</p>
<pre>     zone_to_country = Collections.unmodifiableMap(zone_to_country.clone());</pre>
<p>If a collection <i>(or any other container of objects)</i> itself can contain mutable objects, 
then for a safe clone you need to recurse through it to make the entire collection immutable. The 
recursing code should pick the most specific collection available, to avoid the necessity of later 
downcasing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: </b>A flaw in Java is that the generic collections, like <code>Map</code> or <code>Set</code>, 
  don't have a <code>clone()</code> operation. When you don't know the type of the collection, the 
  simplest course is to just create a new collection:</p>
  <pre>    zone_to_country = Collections.unmodifiableMap(new HashMap(zone_to_country));</pre>
