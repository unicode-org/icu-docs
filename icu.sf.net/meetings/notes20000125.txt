Today's Agenda:
     - New members from Lotus
         Brendan and Eric may not have gotten the meeting notice early
enough to participate this time.  We will inform them ahead of time for
the next meeting.
     - Action item review from the previous meetings
         Action item status:
          [r] : removed
          [-] : completed
          [ ] : open
          [r] T19991108-02 [Laura]          Finalize the name issue with
IBM
marketing.
         ->  We decided to vote by acceptance on the names, 4 options
were presented.  In the parenthesis, the number of votes for that name
selection is recorded.
              International Classes for Unicode (0)
              International Components for Unicode (4)
              International Collections for Unicode (3)
              International Code for Unicode (1)
          We decide that ICU should stand for International Components
for Unicode.
        [ ] T19991123-01 [Helena]         Go over the current APIs and
mark
        draft and stable.
        ->  4 of the components are marked as draft currently,
             1. Conversion function routines that converts from Unicode.

             2. Some of the ResourceBundle APIs.
             3. BreakIterator/RuleBasedBreakIterator interface.
             4. Transliterator interface.
             Everyone agrees that the remaining of the ICU components
should be marked as stable.
        [ ] T19991123-03 [PMC members]    ICU testing issues.
        ->  Progress Software: reorganization going on within the
company.  However, Tex and Steve will still be able to provide feedback
on porting and testing.
              NCR: No funding is allocated for this side effort.  David
and Gary will review the APIs and let us know if they were able to wrap
the existing functionality with ICU.
              Compuware: Bob will write the implementation for global
new/delete operators for our C++ code to use the internal private C
memory allocation functions.  He will report to us the results after he
is done with that.  We will revisit the necessity of runtime OS
abstraction interface in the next meeting.
        [ ] T20000111-01 [Steve L.] The mailing list archive for Jan. is
