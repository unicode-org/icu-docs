Agenda:
1. Prototype of bug system
2. Timezone fixes in ICU4C
3. ICU4J version in Eclipse
4. ICU4J 3.4.5 release
5. Code page conversion binary format change
6. Transliteration failures
7. CLDR
8. Action Items from the previous week's meeting

1. Prototype of Trac bug system
      Steven:
	+ Presented the prototytpe of the new  bug system
      AI: Deborah to send out a list of other projects using Trac

2. Port of Generic TimeZone formatting code to ICU4C
       Ram: 
	+ gave a brief description of the problem

       AI: Mark to contact Doug to and figure out if he has cycles to port the code
       AI: Eric to work with Doug to fix the code

3. ICU4J version in Eclipse
        Ram:
	+ The repository not tagged with appropriate release number
        AI: Vladimir to contact Doug

4. ICU4J 3.4.5 release 
      Yoshito:
	+ Performance fixes in DateFormat need by Eclipse
	+ ICU 3.6 release date not suitable for release schedule of Eclipse
	+ 2 problems in timezone parsing code: partial matching and non-NFC matching
       Mark: 
	+ Idea: dictionary based approach to find the longest match. The dictionary will contain all  strings NFC. Matching algorithm should use Normalizer.equals method for matching
     
      Yoshito:
	+ Implemented a trie based look up for longest match

5. Code page conversion binary format change	
    Markus:
	+ Presented an overview of the binary format change
	+ The new change is incompatible with old format
    Mark:
	+ Option1: Shift to a new format
	+ Option 2: provide a tool to convert the binary in old format to new format
	+ Option 3: Keep the old code around
	+ Hybrid: read the old format in memory and convert it to new format
    Ram:
	+ ICU4J should also be updated with the format change

    AI: Markus to futz around with different options and report back to the group with recommendation.

6. Transliteration failures:
      AI: Ram and Mark to work together to fix the failures

7. CLDR Status:
       Ram: Ready to go out with the release
       Eric:
	+ what was the resolution on minus sign in Farsi
       Mark:
	+ we decided to go ahead with the data for now and revisit in the next release

8. Action Items from the previous week's meeting
       + all done
