<h1>ICU Code Contributions Addendum</h1>
<p>This page contains additional details about the contributions or the joint
copyright assignment letters.</p>

<h2>Adobe</h2>
<p><a name="adobe_jconv"></a>ICU 3.6 contribution of ICU4J conversion code (port  
from ICU4C): Niti Hantaweepant (the Adobe representative and signing  
contributor, see the <a href="Copyright_Assignment_Adobe_JConversion.rtf">softcopy of the Joint Copyright Assignment</a>) 
stated in an email to Markus Scherer (IBM ICU team manager) on 2006-jan-16:</p> 
<pre>Markus,

I confirm that Zartaj Majeed was employed by Adobe at the time of 
working on the contribution, and that therefore his contribution is 
covered by item number 4 of the Contributor Questionnaire.


To quote this question and my answer from the letter:

4) If you are employed by a university (or are a student thereof), 
corporation or other entity, please confirm that you have been given 
permission by the university, corporation or other entity to assign joint 
copyright rights to the Contribution, if applicable.

I confirm that I have been given permission by Adobe Systems Incorporated 
to assign joint copyright rights to the Contribution.

Best regards,
--Niti</pre>
