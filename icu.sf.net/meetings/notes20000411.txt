Agenda:

- Roll call

    See attendee list above.

- Additional agenda items

- Action items from previous meetings

    See action item list below;
    comments from today are marked with today's date.

    As part of the discussion, we assigned due dates to
    most of the action items so that we can concentrate
    in future meetings on the items that are soon due
    instead of discussing the entire list.

- ICU 1.4.2 is released!

- Time for the agenda items that were added in the meeting

  + UnicodeString footprint reduction

    Alan brought into the discussion that the fHashCode field is
    hardly used and could be removed. Markus added that a reduction
    or increase of the fStackBuffer size would be necessary to
    get to "nice" UnicodeString object sizes.
    Agreement to remove fHashCode and 2 UChars for
    32B on 32-bit machines and 40B on 64-bit machines.

  + API to get MIME/IANA names from ICU encoding names
    (& vice versa?)

    Yves and Brendan and others are asking for an API that takes a
    converter or a name, and a "hint", and returns a preferred name,
    like the MIME or IANA preferred name.
    We may also need the opposite, more difficult one:
    Mapping a "standard name" with a "standard/platform/system hint"
    to an ICU converter name.
    Brendan/Lotus has a list of MIME/IANA names.

  + bool_t not portable

    On one platform that we ported ICU to recently (PTX), bool_t is defined
    by platform headers, and is defined to be int or similar,
    becoming the same as an int32_t on this platform.
    This caused some overloaded function signatures to collide.
    ICU cannot compile for such a platform.
    We are going to introduce our own name for the boolean type,
    UBool, and always define it consistently (to int8_t).
    For existing platforms and applications, we will keep the
    bool_t definition. Since it is also an int8_t if we
    define it, nothing will change for existing code using ICU.
