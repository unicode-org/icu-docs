        <h2>Summer of Code 2006</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The ICU Project is pleased to be 
            participating in <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Google's Summer 
                of Code</a> for 2006. We've come up with some exciting project ideas, and 
            we're looking forward to working with you on them.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in working on any of these projects, have questions about them or
            suggestions for other projects we'd love to talk to you. You can contact us at
            <a href="mailto:soc2006@icu-project.org">soc2006@icu-project.org</a>.</p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p><STRONG>Create installable ICU4C packages:</STRONG> Currently, ICU4C is packaged 
            for all Unix-style platforms in a .tgz file. This project is to create native 
            installation packages for each platform. For example, rpm files for Linux, debs 
            files for Debian, etc. You will create scripts that run on each platform to 
            create these packages, and integrate these scripts into the ICU4C release 
            process. For mor details, see Jitterbugs <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=4968">
                4968</a> &amp; <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=4870">
                4870</a>
        for more information.
        <p><STRONG>Port calendars from ICU4J to ICU4C:</STRONG> ICU4J has support for 
            Chinese, Coptic and Ethiopic calendars. These calendars are not supported in 
            ICU4C. This project is to port the code and tests for these calendars to ICU4C. 
            You will also fix some known bugs in the ICU4C and ICU4J calendars. See 
            Jitterbugs <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=4081">4081</a>,
            <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=4571">4571</a> and <i>others</i>
        for more information.
        <p><STRONG>Korean calendar:</STRONG> This project is to implement and test the 
            Korean calendar in both ICU4C and ICU4J. See Jitterbug <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=3268">
                3268</a>
        for more information.
        <p><STRONG>Hindu calendar:</STRONG> This project is to implement and test the Hindu 
            calendar in ICU4C and ICU4J. see Jitterbug <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=4082">
                4082</a>
        for more information.
        <p><STRONG>ICU4J data pruning tool:</STRONG> ICU4J provides a way to modularize by 
            service, but not by locale. This project is to implement a tool that lets ICU4J 
            clients remove unwanted locale data such as collation tables or 
            locale-elemements data files. See Jitterbug <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=3992">
                3992</a>
        for more information.
        <p><STRONG>Visual order code pages:</STRONG> Some codepages, such as ISO-8859-6 and 
            ISO-8859-8, specify text in visual order rather than logical order. This 
            project is to add support for these codepages to the uconv tool. This can be 
            done using ICU's BiDi support. See Jitterbugs <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=5031">
                5031</a> &amp; <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=2621">
                2621</a>
        for more information.
        <p><STRONG>ICU Transliterators:</STRONG> Both ICU4C and ICU4J provide a 
            tranliteration service that can be used to transform streams of text. This 
            service is used, for example, to convert from Cyrillic text to Latin text, and 
            to convert between Kana and romaji text. This project is to&nbsp;create an HTML 
            entity transliterator for ICU4J and ICU4C, and to port the existing Thai 
            transliterator and tests from ICU4J to ICU4C. See Jitterbugs <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=3670">
                3670</a> &amp; <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=4009">
                4009</a>
        for more information.
        <p><STRONG>OpenType support:</STRONG> The ICU LayoutEngine provides support for 
            processing complex scripts using OpenType. Currently there is support for 
            Arabic, Hebrew, Khmer, Tibetan and Indic scripts. This project is to add 
            OpenType support to the LayoutEngine for the Thai, Lao, Syriac and Thaana 
            scripts. See Jitterbugs <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=2382">
                2382</a>, <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=2386">2386</a>,
            <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=2387">2387</a> and <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=2388">
                2388</a>
        for details.
        <p><STRONG>Character encoding detection:</STRONG> Both ICU4C and ICU4J provide character encoding detection. This uses 
        statistical data to examine an arbitrary stream of bytes and guess the 
        encoding. Right now the statistical data is built into the code. This project 
        to to change the code to read the data from an ICU resource bundle. This will 
        include both changes to the encoding detection code, and to the tools that 
        generate the statistical data.&nbsp;You will also add data&nbsp;for more more 
        character encodings.&nbsp;You will work with both ICU4C and ICU4J.
        <p><STRONG>LayoutEngine sample on MacOS X:</STRONG> There is a LayoutEngine sample application that runs on Windows and Linux. 
        This project is to port this&nbsp;application&nbsp;to&nbsp;MacOS X.
        <p><STRONG>LayoutEngine sample on Linux:</STRONG> The LayoutEngine sample application on Linux uses FreeType 1 and Gnome 1. 
        This project is to convert this application to use FreeType 2 and Gnome 2.
        <p><STRONG>Lenient date/time and number parsing:</STRONG> ICU's current 
            implementation of date and number parsing can only correctly parse date/time or 
            number strings that match the strings produced by ICU's date/time and number 
            formatting code. This project is to enhance this parsing so that it can 
            reconnize a wider variation of input. For example, in the US, the date parser 
            will reject an input like "9 June" because the day and the months are not in 
            the correct order. See Jitterbug <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=3579">
                3579</a> (date/time) &amp; <a href="http://bugs.icu-project.org/cgi-bin/icu-bugs?findid=4942">
                4942</a>
        (number) for more information.
        <p><STRONG> ICU4J resource bundle generation:</STRONG> Currently ICU4J resource bundles are generated&nbsp; by generating an ICU4C 
        resource bundle and then converting it to ICU4J format. This project is to 
        modify the resource bundle tool to generate ICU4J resource bundles directly.
        <p><STRONG>ICU4J Demos:</STRONG> Currently all of the ICU4J demos are applications. 
            This project is to develop JSP, servlet or other web based Java demo to show 
            off ICU4J's capabilities. You will convert some of the existing demo 
            applications and design and develop new ones.
