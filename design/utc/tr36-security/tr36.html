  <h2 align="left"><a name="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Unicode represents a very significant advance over all previous methods of encoding characters. 
  For the first time, all of the worlds characters could be represented in a uniform manner, for the 
  first time making it feasible for the vast majority of programs to be <i>globalized:</i> built to 
  handle any language in the world.</p>
  <p>In many ways, the use of Unicode makes programs much more robust and secure. When systems need 
  to use a hodge-podge of different charsets for representing characters, it was possible to take 
  advantage of differences between those charsets, or in the way in which programs converted to and 
  from them.</p>
  <p>However, because Unicode contains such a large number of characters, and because it 
  incorporates the varied writing systems of the world, incorrect usage can expose programs or 
  systems to possible security attacks. This document describes some of the security considerations 
  that should be taken into account by programmers, system analysts, standards-developers, and 
  users.</p>
  <p>We anticipate that this document will grow over time, adding additional sections as needed. 
  Initially, there are two areas that will be discussed: canonical representation and visual 
  spoofing. For more information, see also the Unicode
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/security.html">FAQ on Security Issues</a>.</p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Each section below presents a background information on the kinds of 
  problems that can occur, then a list of specific recommendations for avoiding the problems.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="reviewnote"><b>Note to Reviewers:</b> Some of the examples below use Unicode 
    characters which some browsers will not show, or may not show in a way that illustrates the 
    problem. For more information about improving the display, see [<a href="#Display">Display</a>]. 
    In the final version, we&#39;ll prepare GIFs for the characters where necessary.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2><a name="Canonical_Represenation"></a>2. Canonical Representation</h2>
  <p>A common practice is to have a &#39;gatekeeper&#39; for a system. That gatekeeper checks over incoming 
  data to ensure that it is safe, and passes only safe data through. Once in the system, the other 
  components assume that the data is safe. A problem arises when a component treats two pieces of 
  text as identical — typically by canonicalizing them to the same form — while the gatekeeper only 
  detected that one of them was unsafe.</p>
  <h3><a name="UTF-8_Exploit">UTF-8 Exploit</a></h3>
  <p>There are three equivalent encoding forms for Unicode: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. UTF-8 is 
  commonly used in XML and HTML; UTF-16 is the most common in program APIs; and UTF-32 is the best 
  for representing single characters. While these forms are all equivalent in terms of the ability 
  to express Unicode, the original usage of UTF-8 was open to a canonicalization exploit.</p>
  <p>Up to <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/u2.html"><i>The Unicode Standard, 
  Version 3.0</i></a> the <i>generation</i> of &quot;non-shortest form&quot; UTF-8 was forbidden, and as was 
  the <i>interpretation</i> of illegal sequences, but not the interpretation of what was called the 
  &quot;non-shortest form&quot;. Where software does interpret the non-shortest forms, security issues can 
  arise. For example: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Process <i>A</i> performs security checks, but does not check for non-shortest forms. </li>
    <li>Process <i>B</i> accepts the byte sequence from process <i>A</i>, and transforms it into 
    UTF-16 while interpreting non-shortest forms. </li>
    <li>The UTF-16 text may then contain characters that should have been filtered out by process <i>
    A</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, the backslash character &quot;\&quot; can often be a dangerous character to let through a 
  gatekeeper, since it can be used to access different directories. Thus a gatekeeper might 
  specifically prevent it from getting through. The backslash is represented in UTF-8 as the byte 
  sequence &lt;5C&gt;. However, as a non-shortest form, backslash could also be represented as the byte 
  sequence&lt;C1 9C&gt;. When a gatekeeper doesn&#39;t catch that, but a component converts non-shortest 
  forms, it can allow a real security breech. For more information, see
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-078.mspx">
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-078.mspx</a> and

  http://www.ins.com/downloads/whitepapers/ins_white_paper_ms_iis_unicode_exploit_0801.pdf</a>.</p>
  <p>To address this issue, the Unicode Technical Committee modified the definition of UTF-8 in
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr27/">Unicode 3.1</a> to forbid conformant 
  implementations from interpreting non-shortest forms for
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#BMP_character">BMP characters</a>, and clarified some of 
  the conformance clauses.</p>

  <h2><a name="visual_spoofing"></a>3. Visual Spoofing</h2>
  <p>Visual spoofing is where a similarity in visual appearance fools a user, and causes him or her 
  to take unsafe actions. This is not new to Unicode: it was possible to spoof simply with ASCII 
  character: &quot;<font face="sans-serif">inteI.com</font>&quot; for example, uses a capital I instead of an 
  L. The infamous example here is of course &quot;<font face="sans-serif">paypaI.com</font>&quot;:&nbsp; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="stBodyText"><font size="2">... Not only was &quot;Paypai.com&quot; very convincing, but the scam 
    artist even goes one step further. He or she is apparently emailing PayPal customers, saying 
    they have a large payment waiting for them in their account.</font></p>
    <p class="stBodyText"><font size="2">The message then offers up a link, urging the recipient to 
    claim the funds. But the URL that is displayed for the unwitting victim uses a capital &quot;i&quot; (I), 
    which looks just like a lowercase &quot;L&quot; (l), in many computer fonts. ...</font></p>
    <p class="stBodyText" align="right"><span class="h1"><font size="2">— </font>
    <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/security/0,39020375,2080344,00.htm"><font size="2">
    Beware the &#39;PaypaI&#39; scam</font></a></span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And the spoofs nowadays are pretty clever. One is an email that looks like it comes from a 
  trusted source, like your bank. It even has an explicit disclaimer to not trust links in email, 
  and directs you to copy text to your address bar in your browser. The text looks ok to you, so you 
  won&#39;t realize that you are going to a completely different site, which is then set up to simulate 
  your bank well enough to get your password.</p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">These spoofs depend on the use of <i>visually confusable</i> strings:</span></p>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border-width: 0">
    <tr>
      <td class="noborder"><span class="changedSpan"><b>D1. </b></span></td>
      <td class="noborder"><span class="changedSpan">Two different strings of Unicode characters are 
      said to be <i>visually confusable</i> when their appearance in common fonts in small sizes at 
      screen resolutions is sufficiently close that people easily mistake one for the other.</span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">There are no hard-and-fast rules for visual confusability: it is of 
  course possible to make any characters look like any others with a suitably faulty font. By 
  &quot;small-sizes at screen resolutions&quot;, this means fonts whose ascent + descent is from 9 to 12 
  pixels for most scripts, somewhat larger for scripts where the font size users typically have is 
  larger, such as Japanese. Of course, at sufficiently small sizes, such as 4px, a great many 
  characters would become confusable. In some cases sequences of characters can be used to spoof: 
  for example, &quot;rn&quot; (&quot;r&quot; followed by &quot;n&quot;) in many san-serif fonts is visually confusable with &quot;m&quot;. 
  Where two different strings are essentially identical in most fonts at all sizes, they are called
  <i>homographs</i>. However, spoofing is not dependent on just homographs; if the visual appearance 
  is close enough at small sizes, that can be sufficient to cause problems.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Note that characters are not visually confusable if the positioning 
  of the glyph is sufficiently different. For example, foo·com (using the hyphenation point instead 
  of the period) should be distinguishable from foo.com by the positioning of the dot (except in 
  faulty fonts).</span></p>
  <p>To a certain extent, the new forms of visual spoofing available with Unicode are a matter of 
  degree and not kind. However, because of the very large number of Unicode characters (over 94,000 
  in the current version), the number of opportunities for visual spoofing are significantly larger 
  than with a restricted character set such as ASCII.</p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">For examples of visually confusable characters, see [<a href="#confusables">confusables</a>].</span></p>
  <h3><a name="international_domain_names"></a>International Domain Names</h3>
  <p>Spoofing is an especially important subject given the recent introduction of international 
  domain names (IDN). There is a natural desire for people to see domain names in their own 
  languages and writing systems; English speakers can understand this if they consider what it would 
  be like if they always had to type web addresses with Russian characters! So IDN represents a very 
  significant advance for most people in the world. The avoidance of spoofing vulnerability requires 
  proper implementation in browsers and other programs, <span class="changedSpan">so as to minimize 
  security risks without making the use of non-ASCII character too onerous.</span></p>
  <p>International domain names are, of course, not the only cases where visual spoofing can occur. 
  For example, you might get a message asking you to allow allowing the installation of software 
  from &quot;IBM&quot;, authenticated with the proper Verisign certificate, but the &quot;M&quot; character happens to 
  be the Russian (Cyrillic) character that looks precisely like the English &quot;M&quot;.
  <span class="changedSpan"><i>Any place where strings are used as identifiers is subject to this 
  kind of spoofing.</i> For more information on identifers, see
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/">UAX #31: <i>Identifier and Pattern Syntax</i></a>.</span></p>
  <p>However, IDN provides a good starting point for a discussion of visual spoofing. The good news 
  is that the design of IDN prevents a huge number of spoofing attacks. All conformant users of IDN 
  are required to process domain names to convert <i>
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#compatibility_equivalent">compatibility-equivalent</a></i> 
  characters into a unique form; this processing eliminates most of the possibilities for visual 
  spoofing by mapping away a large number of visually confusable characters and sequences. For 
  example, Unicode contains the &quot;<font SIZE="3">ä&quot; (a-umlaut) character, but also contains a 
  free-standing umlaut (&quot;¨&quot;) which can be used in combination with any character, including an &quot;a&quot;. 
  But the compatibility normalization will convert any sequence of &quot;a&quot; plus &quot;¨&quot; into the regular
  </font>&quot;<font SIZE="3">ä&quot;. </font></p>
  <p>Thus you can&#39;t spoof an <i>a-umlaut</i> with <i>a + umlaut</i>; it simply results in the same 
  domain name. See example 1 below. The String column shows the actual characters; the UTF-16 shows 
  the underlying encoding, while the IDNA column shows the IDNA format used to represent the string 
  internally in International Domain Names.</p>

    <p><b>Note: </b>The ICU demo at <a href="http://ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/demo/domain/">
    http://ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/demo/domain/</a> can be used to demonstrate the 
    results of processing different domain names. That demo was also used to get the IDNA values 
    shown here.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">The IDN processing also removes case distinctions by performing a <i>
  case folding</i> to reduce characters to a lowercase form<i>.</i> This is also useful for avoiding 
  spoofing problems, since characters are generally more distinctive in their lowercase forms. That 
  means that we can focus on just the lowercase characters.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">For a list of allowable characters in IDN, see [<a href="#idn-chars">idn-chars</a>]. 
  There are many misperceptions about which characters are allowed in IDN, so referencing this 
  explicit list should be useful for dispelling some of them. The characters are those left after 
  string processing has been performed, so case-folding and normalization have already been applied.
  </span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Although normalization and case-folding prevent many possible 
  spoofing attacks, </span>there remain many cases where visual spoofing can still occur with 
  international domain names. <span class="changedSpan">Ideally, much of this would be handled on 
  the registries&#39; side instead of user-agents (browsers, emailers, and other programs that display 
  and process URLs). The registry has the most data available, and process it the most efficiently 
  at the time of registration, using policies to reduce visual spoofing. For example, given 
  confusable mapping data, the registry can easily determine if a proposed registration conflicts 
  with an existing one; that is much more difficult for user agents because of the sheer number of 
  combinations that it would have to probe.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">However:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="changedSpan">the user agent has more control over the display of characters, 
    which is crucial to spoofing</span></li>
    <li><span class="changedSpan">there are legitimate cases of visually confusable characters that 
    one may want to allow <i>after</i> alerting the user.</span></li>
    <li><span class="changedSpan">one cannot depend on all registries being equally responsive to 
    security issues</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">So efforts need to be made on the part of user-agents as an 
  additional line of defense.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="changedSpan"><b>Note: </b>since the top-level domain names (TLD: .com, .ru, 
    etc.) is currently always ASCII, all discussions below of the domain names pertain to all but 
    the top level.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3><b>Cross-Script Spoofing</b></h3>
  <p>Visually confusable characters are not usually unified across scripts. Thus a Greek <i>omicron</i> 
  is encoded as a different character from the Latin &quot;o&quot;, even though it is usually identical
  <span class="changedSpan">or nearly identical</span> in appearance. <span class="changedSpan">
  There are good reasons for this: often the characters were separate in legacy encodings, and 
  preservation of those distinctions was necessary for existing data to be mapped to Unicode without 
  loss. Moreover, the characters generally have very different behavior: two visually confusable 
  characters may be different in casing behavior, in category (letter vs. number), or in numeric 
  value. After all, ASCII doesn&#39;t unify lowercase L and digit 1, even though those are visually 
  confusable. Encoding the Cyrillic character б (corresponding to the letter &quot;b&quot;) by using the 
  numeral 6, would clearly have been a mistake, even though they are visually confusable.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">However, the existence of these cases </span>means that there is a 
  significant number of spoofing possibilities using characters from different scripts. For example, 
  a domain name can be spoofed by using a Greek omicron instead of an &#39;o&#39;, as in example 2a.</p>

  <p>There are many legitimate uses of mixed scripts. <span class="changedSpan">Because of the 
  prevalence of Latin characters, </span>it is quite common, for example, to use English words (with 
  Latin characters) in the middle of other languages using other scripts. <span class="changedSpan">
  For example, one could have XML-документы.com (which would be a site for &quot;XML documents&quot; in 
  Russian). Even in English, legitimate product or organization names or may contain non-Latin 
  characters, such as Ωmega, Teχ, Toys-Я-Us, or HλLF-LIFE. The lack of IDNs in the past has also led 
  to the usage in some registries (such as the .ru TLD) where Latin names have been used to create 
  pseudo-cyrillic names in the .ru tld. For example, see <a href="http://caxap.ru/">http://caxap.ru/</a> 
  (сахар means sugar in Russian)</span>.</p>
  <p>The Unicode Standard supplies information that can be used for detecting mixed-script text: for 
  more information, see UAX #24: <i><a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/">Script Names</a></i>.</p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Cyrillic and Latin represent special challenges, since the number of 
  common glyphs shared between them is so high, as can be seen from [<a href="#idn-chars">idn-chars</a>]. 
  It may be possible to compose an entire domain name (except the TLD) in Cyrillic using letters 
  that will be essentially always identical in form to Latin letters, such as &quot;scope.com&quot;: with 
  &quot;scope&quot; in Cyrillic looking just like &quot;scope&quot; in Latin. These are called <i>whole-script 
  confusables.</i></span></p>
  <h3>In-Script Spoofing</h3>
  <p>While compatibility normalization and mixed-script detection can handle the vast majority of 
  cases, there are other visual confusables that could cause problems. With fonts increasing able to 
  handle international characters, and <i>especially</i> with smaller font sizes in the context of 
  an address bar, these visual confusables could be used to spoof. Importantly, these problems can 
  be illustrated with common, widely available fonts on widely available operating systems
  <font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">—</font> this is not pointing a finger at any one vendor.</p>
  <p>Consider the following examples, all in the same script. In each numbered case, in commonly 
  available browsers, the strings will look identical.</p>

  <h3>Inadequate Rendering Support</h3>
  <p>An additional problem arises when a font and/or rendering engine has inadequate support for 
  certain sequences of characters. These are characters that <i>should</i> be visually 
  distinguishable, but don&#39;t appear that way. In example 8a, the <i>a-umlaut</i> is followed by 
  another <i>umlaut</i>. The Unicode Standard guidelines indicate that the second <i>umlaut</i> 
  should be &#39;stacked&#39; above the first, producing a distinct visual difference. But as this example 
  shows, common fonts will simply superimpose the second <i>umlaut</i>; and if the positioning is 
  close enough, the user will not see a difference between 8a and 8b.</p>

  <p>In example 9, we have an even worse case. The <i>underdot</i> character in 9a is <i>actually</i> 
  under the &#39;l&#39;, but in many fonts, it appears as under the &#39;e&#39;! It is thus visually confusable with 
  9b (where the <i>underdot</i> is under the e) or the equivalent normalized form 9c.</p>
  <h3><span class="changedSpan">Syntax Spoofing</span></h3>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Spoofing syntax characters can be even worse than regular characters. 
  For example, U+2044 &#39;<span title="U+2044 FRACTION SLASH">⁄&#39; <span style="font-variant: small-caps">
  FRACTION SLASH</span> can look like &#39;/&#39; in many fonts (ideally the spacing and angle is 
  sufficiently different as to be distinguishable, but this is not always maintained. </span>This 
  allows http://www.example.org/not.mydomain.com to pretend to be in the <i>example.org</i> domain, 
  whereas it is actually the subzone <i>www.example.org/not</i> in the domain <i>mydomain.com</i>. 
  Thus anything that is visually similar to &#39;.&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;#&#39;, is especially dangerous. Most of these 
  cases, such as U+2024 (·) <span style="font-variant: small-caps">ONE DOT LEADER</span> are 
  disallowed by StringPrep, but not all.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">It is important also not to show a missing glyph or character with a 
  simple &quot;?&quot;, since that makes every such character be visually confusable with a real question 
  mark. Instead, follow the Unicode guidelines for displaying missing glyphs using a 
  rounded-rectangle, as described in Section
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch05.pdf">5.3 <i>Unknown and Missing 
  Characters</i></a> of [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].&nbsp; For examples of this, see also [<a href="#Charts">Charts</a>].</span></p>
  <h3><span class="changedSpan">Numeric Spoofs</span></h3>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Turning away from IDN for a moment, there is another area where 
  visual spoofs can be used. Many scripts have sets of decimal digits that are different in shape 
  that the typical European digits {0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}. For example, Bengali has
  <span title="U+09E6 BENGALI DIGIT ZERO">{০ </span><span title="U+09E7 BENGALI DIGIT ONE">১</span><span title="U+09F4 BENGALI CURRENCY NUMERATOR ONE">
  </span><span title="U+09E8 BENGALI DIGIT TWO">২</span><span title="U+09F5 BENGALI CURRENCY NUMERATOR TWO">
  </span><span title="U+09E9 BENGALI DIGIT THREE">৩ </span><span title="U+09EA BENGALI DIGIT FOUR">৪
  </span><span title="U+09EB BENGALI DIGIT FIVE">৫ </span><span title="U+09EC BENGALI DIGIT SIX">৬
  </span><span title="U+09ED BENGALI DIGIT SEVEN">৭ </span><span title="U+09EE BENGALI DIGIT EIGHT">
  ৮ </span><span title="U+09EF BENGALI DIGIT NINE">৯}, while Oriya has </span>{<span title="U+0B66 ORIYA DIGIT ZERO">୦
  </span><span title="U+0B67 ORIYA DIGIT ONE">୧ </span><span title="U+0B68 ORIYA DIGIT TWO">୨ </span>
  <span title="U+0B69 ORIYA DIGIT THREE">୩ </span><span title="U+0B6A ORIYA DIGIT FOUR">୪ </span>
  <span title="U+0B6B ORIYA DIGIT FIVE">୫ </span><span title="U+0B6C ORIYA DIGIT SIX">୬ </span>
  <span title="U+0B6D ORIYA DIGIT SEVEN">୭ </span><span title="U+0B6E ORIYA DIGIT EIGHT">୮ </span>
  <span title="U+0B6F ORIYA DIGIT NINE">୯}. While the sets taken as a whole are different in shape, 
  individual digits may have the same shapes as digits from other scripts, even digits of different 
  values. For example, the string </span><b><span title="U+09EA BENGALI DIGIT FOUR">৪</span></b><span title="U+0B68 ORIYA DIGIT TWO"><b>୨</b> 
  is visually confusable with <b>89</b> (at small sizes), but actually has the numeric value 42! 
  Where software simply interprets the numeric value of a string of digits, without detecting that 
  the digits are from different scripts, it is possible to generate such spoofs.</span></span></p>
  <h3><span class="changedSpan"><a name="Visual_Spoofing_Recommendations">Recommendations</a></span></h3>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">We are in the process of gathering data that would allow for a 
  finer-grained approach, but until such time as that is more comprehensive, we&#39;d recommend having a 
  more conservative stance. It is always easier to widen restrictions than narrow them. We do expect 
  these recommendations to be refined over time.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Some people have proposed prevention of spoofing by restricting 
  domain names according to language. In practice, that is very problematic. It is very difficult to 
  determine the intended language of many terms, especially product or company names, which are 
  often constructed to be neutral regarding language. Moreover, languages tend to be quite fluid; 
  foreign words are continually being adopted. Except for registries with very special policies 
  (such as the blocking used by some East Asian<br>
  registries such as described in <a href="http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3743.txt?number=3743">RFC 3743</a>), 
  the language association doesn&#39;t make too much sense. </span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">Instead, what is recommended is a combination of string preprocessing 
  to remove basic equivalences, promoting adequate rendering support, and putting restrictions in 
  place according to script and restricting by confusable characters. While the ICANN guidelines say 
  &quot;top-level domain registries will (a) associate each registered internationalized domain name with 
  one language or set of languages&quot; (<a href="http://www.icann.org/general/idn-guidelines-20jun03.htm">http://www.icann.org/general/idn-guidelines-20jun03.htm</a>), 
  that is better interpreted as limiting to script rather than language.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">In the following, &quot;appropriate alerts&quot; are recommended. The form of 
  such alerts could be minimal, such as special coloring or icons (perhaps with a tool-tip for more 
  information), or more in-your-face, such as an alert dialog describing the issue and requiring 
  user confirmation before continuing. The strength of the alert can be scaled according to the 
  level of the potential problem. The user-agent could also remember when the user has accepted an 
  alert, for say Ωmega.com, and permit future access without bothering the user again with an alert.</span></p>
  <p><span class="changedSpan">The term &quot;Registry&quot; is to be interpreted broadly. The .com operator 
  can impose restrictions on the 2nd level domain label, <br>
  but if someone registers foo.com, then it&#39;s up to them to decide what will be allowed at the 3rd 
  level (e.g. bar.foo.com). So for that purpose, the owner of foo.com is treated as the &quot;registry&quot; 
  for the 3rd level (the &#39;bar&#39;). The term &quot;Registrant&quot; is used to refer to someone applying to a 
  registry for a domain name.</span></p>

    <p class="reviewnote"><span class="changedSpan">Describe how TrueType/OpenType fonts can be used 
    in spoofing: fonts are actually programs that can deform glyph shapes radically according to 
    resolution, platform, or language. For example $100.00 could appear as $200.00 when printed.</span></li>

    <p class="reviewnote">Add other applications of visual spoofing, aside from the example of IDN. 
    International domain names are actually in much better shape than many other areas, since the
