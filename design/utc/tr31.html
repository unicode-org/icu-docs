  <h2 align="left"><a name="Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>A common task facing an implementer of the Unicode Standard is the provision of a parsing 
  and/or lexing engine for identifiers. To assist in the standard treatment of identifiers in 
  Unicode character-based parsers, a set of specifications is provided here as a recommended default 
  for the definition of identifier syntax. These guidelines are no more complex than current rules 
  in the common programming languages, except that they include more characters of different types.
  </p>
  <p>In addition, this document provides the definition of the Unicode properties used to define 
  stable pattern syntax: syntax that is stable over future versions of the Unicode Standard. It also 
  provides guidelines for the user of normalization with identifiers, originally in UAX #15.</p>
  <h3>1.1 <a name="Conformance">Conformance</a></h3>

  <h2>2. <a name="Default_Identifier_Syntax">Default Identifier Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>The formal syntax provided here is intended to capture the general intent that an identifier 
  consists of a string of characters that begins with a letter or an ideograph, and then includes 
  any number of letters, ideographs, digits, or underscores. Each programming language standard has 
  its own identifier syntax; different programming languages have different conventions for the use 
  of certain characters from the ASCII range ($, @, #, _) in identifiers. To extend such a syntax to 
  cover the full behavior of a Unicode implementation, implementers need only combine these specific 
  rules with the syntax provided here. </p>
  <h4>D1. Default Identifier Syntax</h4>
  <p><code>&lt;identifier&gt; := &lt;identifier_start&gt; &lt;identifier_continue&gt;*</code> </p>
  <p>Identifiers are defined by the following sets of character categories from the Unicode 
  Character Database.</p>
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <caption><b>Syntactic Classes for Identifiers</b></caption>
    <tr>
      <th align="left">Syntactic Class</th>
      <th align="left">Properties</th>
      <th align="left">Coverage</th>

      punctuation, formatting code<span>, stability extensions</span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The innovations in the identifier syntax to cover the Unicode Standard include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incorporation of proper handling of combining marks </li>
    <li>Allowance for layout and format control characters, which should be ignored when parsing 
    identifiers</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.1 Combining Marks</h3>
  <p>Combining marks are accounted for in identifier syntax. A composed character sequence 
  consisting of a base character followed by any number of combining marks must be valid for an 
  identifier. This requirement results from the requirement for combining marks in the 
  representation of many languages, and the conformance rules in Chapter 3 regarding interpretation 
  of canonical-equivalent character sequences. </p>
  <p>Enclosing combining marks (for example, <code>U+20DD..U+20E0</code>) are excluded from the 
  syntactic definition of <code>&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</code>, because the composite characters that 
  result from their composition with letters (for example, U+24B6
  <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">circled latin capital letter a</span>) are themselves not 
  normally considered valid constituents of these identifiers.</p>
  <h3>2.2 Layout and Format Control Characters</h3>
  <p>The Unicode characters that are used to control joining behavior, bidirectional ordering 
  control, and alternative formats for display are explicitly defined as not affecting breaking 
  behavior. Unlike space characters or other delimiters, they do not serve to indicate word, line, 
  or other unit boundaries. Accordingly, they should normally be ignored for the purposes of 
  identifier definition. Implementations that cannot ignore characters in identifiers should exclude 
  these characters. </p>
  <h3>2.3 Specific Character Adjustments</h3>
  <p>Specific identifier syntaxes can be treated as tailorings of the generic syntax based on 
  character properties. For example, SQL identifiers allow an underscore as an identifier part (but 
  not as an identifier start); C identifiers allow an underscore as either an identifier part or an 
  identifier start. Specific languages may also want to exclude the characters that have a <code>
  decomposition_type</code> other than <code>canonical</code> or <code>none</code>, or to exclude 
  some subset of those, such as those with a <code>decomposition_type</code> equal to <code>font</code>.
  </p>
  <p>For programming language identifiers, <span>normalization and case have a number of important 
  implications. For a discussion of these issues, see </span><a href="#normalization_and_case">
  <span>Normalization and Case</span></a><span>.</span></p>
  <h3>2.4 Backward Compatibility</h3>
  <p>Unicode General Category values are kept as stable as possible, but they can change across 
  versions of the Unicode Standard. The Other_ID_Start property contains a small list of characters 
  that qualified as <code>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</code> characters in some previous version of Unicode 
  solely on the basis of their General Category properties, but that no longer qualify in the 
  current version. In Unicode 4.0, this list consists of four characters: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>U+2118 <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">script capital p</span> </li>
    <li>U+212E <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">estimated symbol</span> </li>
    <li>U+309B <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">katakana-hiragana voiced sound mark</span>
    </li>
    <li>U+309C <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">katakana-hiragana semi-voiced sound mark</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Similarly, the Other_ID_Continue property contains a small list of characters that qualified as
  <code>&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</code> characters in some previous version of Unicode solely on the 
  basis of their General Category properties, but that no longer qualify in the current version.</p>
  <p>The Other_ID_Start and <span>Other_ID_Continue</span><span> properties are</span> thus designed 
  to ensure that the Unicode identifier specification is backward compatible: Any sequence of 
  characters that qualified as an identifier in some version of Unicode will continue to qualify as 
  an identifier in future versions.</p>

  <h2>3. <a name="Alternative_Identifier_Syntax">Alternative Identifier Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>The down-side of working with the syntactic classes defined above is the storage space needed 
  for the detailed definitions, plus the fact that with each new version of the Unicode Standard new 
  characters are added, which an existing parser would not be able to recognize. In other words, the 
  recommendations based on that table are not upwardly compatible. </p>
  <p>One method to address this problem is to turn the question around. Instead of defining the set 
  of code points that are allowed, define a small, fixed set of code points that are reserved for 
  syntactic use and allow everything else (including unassigned code points) as part of an 
  identifier. All parsers written to this specification would behave the same way for all versions 
  of the Unicode Standard, because the classification of code points is fixed forever. </p>
  <p>The drawback of this method is that it allows “nonsense” to be part of identifiers because the 
  concerns of lexical classification and of human intelligibility are separated. Human 
  intelligibility can, however, be addressed by other means, such as usage guidelines that encourage 
  a restriction to meaningful terms for identifiers. For an example of such guidelines, see the XML 
  1.1 specification by the W3C [<a href="#XML1.1">XML1.1</a>]. </p>
  <p>By increasing the set of disallowed characters, a reasonably intuitive recommendation for 
  identifiers can be achieved. This approach uses the full specification of identifier classes, as 
  of a particular version of the Unicode Standard, and permanently disallows any characters not 
  recommended in that version for inclusion in identifiers. All code points unassigned as of that 
  version would be allowed in identifiers, so that any future additions to the standard would 
  already be accounted for. This approach ensures both upwardly compatible identifier stability and 
  a reasonable division of characters into those that do and do not make human sense as part of 
  identifiers. </p>
  <p>Some additional extensions to the list of disallowed code points can be made to further 
  constrain “unnatural” identifiers. For example, one could include unassigned code points in blocks 
  of characters set aside for future encoding as symbols, such as mathematical operators. </p>
  <p>With or without such fine-tuning, such a compromise approach still incurs the expense of 
  implementing large lists of code points. While they no longer change over time, it is a matter of 
  choice whether the benefit of enforcing somewhat word-like identifiers justifies their cost.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, one can use the properties described below, and allow all sequences of 
  characters to be identifiers that are neither pattern syntax nor pattern whitespace. This has the 
  advantage of simplicity and small tables, but allows many more “unnatural” identifiers.</p>
  <table class="noborder">

      <td class="noborder"><a name="R2" href="#R2">R2</a></td>
      <td class="noborder">Alternative Identifiers</td>

      characters;<p>or shall declare that it uses a modification, and provide a precise list of 
      characters that are added to or removed from the sets of code points defined by these 
      properties.<br>
&nbsp; </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h2>4. <a name="Pattern_Syntax">Pattern Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>There are many circumstances where software interprets patterns that are a mixture of literal 
  characters, whitespace, and syntax characters. Examples include regular expressions, Java 
  collation rules, Excel or ICU number formats, and many others. These patterns have been very 
  limited in the past, and forced to use clumsy combinations of ASCII characters for their syntax. 
  As Unicode becomes ubiquitous, some of these will start to use non-ASCII characters for their 
  syntax: first as more readable optional alternatives, then eventually as the standard syntax.</p>
  <p>For forwards and backwards compatibility, it is very advantageous to have a fixed set of 
  whitespace and syntax code points for use in patterns. This follows the recommendations that the 
  Unicode Consortium made regarding completely stable identifiers, and the practice that is seen in 
  XML 1.1 [<a href="#XML1.1">XML1.1</a>]. (In particular, the consortium committed to not allocating 
  characters suitable for identifiers in the range 2190..2BFF, which is being used by XML 1.1.)</p>
  <p>With a fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points, a pattern language can then have a 
  policy requiring all possible syntax characters (even ones currently unused) to be quoted if they 
  are literals. By using this policy, it preserves the freedom to extend the syntax in the future by 
  using those characters. Past patterns on future systems will always work; future patterns on past 
  systems will signal an error instead of silently producing the wrong results.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Example:</i></p>
    <p>In version 1.3 of program X, &#39;≈&#39; is a reserved syntax character, e.g. it doesn&#39;t perform an 
    operation, but you have to quote it. In version 1.4, &#39;≈&#39; gets a real meaning, e.g. uppercase the 
    subsequent characters. In this example, &#39;\&#39; <i>quotes</i> the next character; i.e., causes it to 
    be treated as a literal instead of a syntax character.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The pattern abc...\≈...xyz works on both version 1.3 and 1.4, and refers to the literal 
      character since it is quoted in both cases. </li>
      <li>The pattern abc...≈...xyz works on 1.1 and uppercases the following characters. On version 
      1.0, the engine (rightfully) has no idea what to do with ≈. Rather than silently fail (by 
      ignoring ≈ or turning it into a literal), it has the opportunity signal an error.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span class="changedspan">As of Unicode 4.1, there are two Unicode character properties that 
  can be used for for stable syntax: Pattern_White_Space and Pattern_Syntax. </span>&nbsp;Particular 
  pattern languages may, of course, override these recommendations (for example, adding or removing 
  other characters for compatibility in ASCII). </p>
  <p>For stability, the property values are absolutely invariant; not changing with successive 
  versions of Unicode. Of course, this doesn&#39;t limit the ability of the Unicode Standard to add more 
  symbol or whitespace characters, but the syntax and whitespace characters recommended for use in 
  patterns would not change.</p>
  <p>When <i>generating</i> rules or patterns, all whitespace and syntax code points that are to be 
  literals would require quoting (using whatever quoting mechanism is available). For readability, 
  it is recommended practice to quote or escape all literal whitespace and default ignorable code 
  points as well.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>Example: </i>consider the following, where the items in angle brackets indicate literal 
    characters.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a<span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;SPACE&gt;</span>b =&gt; x<span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;ZERO 
      WIDTH SPACE&gt;</span>y&nbsp; + z;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since <span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;SPACE&gt;</span> is a Pattern_White_Space 
    character, it would require quoting. Since <span style="font-variant: small-caps">&lt;ZERO WIDTH 
    SPACE&gt;</span> is a default ignorable character, it should also be quoted for readability. So if 
    in this example \uXXXX is used for hex expression, but resolved before quoting, and single 
    quotes are used for quoting, this might be expressed as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&#39;a\u0020b&#39; =&gt; &#39;x\u200By&#39; + z;</li>

  <p><span>If programming languages are using </span><span>NFKC</span><span> to level (&quot;fold&quot;)

    processes will assume its use as punctuation, rather than as a letter extender.) </span></li>
    <li><b><span>Combining-like characters. </span></b><span>Certain characters are not formally 
    combining characters, although they behave in most respects as if they were. Ideally, they 
    should not be in </span><code><span>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span>, but rather in </span>
    <code><span>&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</span></code><span>, along with combining characters. In most 
    cases, the mismatch does not cause a problem, but when these characters have compatibility 
    decompositions, they can cause identifiers not to be closed under Normalization Form KC. In 
    particular, the following four characters are to be in </span><code><span>&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</span></code><span> 
    and not </span><code><span>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span>: </span>
    <ul>
      <li><code><span>0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM</span></code><span> </span></li>
      <li><code><span>0EB3 LAO VOWEL SIGN AM</span></code><span> </span></li>
      <li><code><span>FF9E HALFWIDTH KATAKANA VOICED SOUND MARK</span></code><span> </span></li>
      <li><code><span>FF9F HALFWIDTH KATAKANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK</span></code><span> </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><span>Irregularly decomposing characters. </span></b><code><span>U+037A GREEK 
    YPOGEGRAMMENI</span></code><span> and certain Arabic presentation forms have irregular 
    compatibility decompositions, and must be excluded from both </span><code><span>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span> 
    and </span><code><span>&lt;identifier_continue&gt;</span></code><span>. It is recommended that all 
    Arabic presentation forms be excluded from identifiers in any event, although only a few of them 
    are required to be excluded for normalization to guarantee identifier closure. </span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><span>With these amendments to the identifier syntax, all identifiers are closed under all four 
  Normalization forms. This means that for any string S,</span></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span>isIdentifier(S) implies</span></code></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span>isIdentifier(toNFD(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFC(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFKD(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toNFKC(S))</span></code></p>
  <p><span>Identifiers are also closed under case operations (with one exception), so that for any 
  string S,</span></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span>&nbsp;isIdentifier(S) implies</span></code></p>
  <p align="center"><code><span>isIdentifier(toLowercase(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toUppercase(S))<br>
  isIdentifier(toFoldedcase(S))</span></code></p>
  <p><span>The one exception is </span><code><span>U+0345 COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI</span></code><span>. 
  In the very unusual case that </span><code><span>U+0345</span></code><span> is at the start of S,&nbsp;
  </span><code><span>U+0345</span></code><span> is not in </span><code><span>&lt;identifier_start&gt;</span></code><span>, 
  but its uppercase and case-folder version are. In practice this is not a problem, because of the 
  way normalization is used with identifiers.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>Those programming languages with case-insensitive identifiers 
    should use the case </span><span>foldings</span><span> described in </span><i><span>Section 3.13 
    Default Case Operations</span></i><span> to produce a case-insensitive normalized form.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span>When source text (such as program source) is parsed for identifiers, the identifiers must 
  be parsed before folding distinctions using case mapping or </span><span>NFKC</span><span>.</span></p>
  <p><span>When source text (such as program source) is parsed for identifiers, the folding of 
  distinctions (using case mapping or </span><span>NFKC</span><span>) must be delayed until after 
  parsing has located the identifiers. Thus such folding of distinctions should not be applied to 
  string literals or to comments in program source text.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>The Unicode Character Database [</span><a href="#UCD"><span>UCD</span></a><span>] 
    provides derived properties that can be used by implementations for parsing identifiers, both 
    normalized and </span><span>unnormalized</span><span>. These are the properties </span><code>
    <span>ID_Start</span></code><span>, </span><code><span>ID_Continue</span></code><span>, </span>
    <code><span>XID_Start</span></code><span>, and </span><code><span>XID_Continue</span></code><span>. 
    Unicode 3.1 also provides support for handling case folding with normalization: the </span>
    <span class="old_changed"><span>Unicode Character Database property FC_NFKC_Closure</span></span><span> 
    can be used in case folding, so that a case folding of an </span><span>NFKC</span><span> string 
    is itself normalized. These properties, and the files containing them, are described in the
    </span><span>UCD</span><span> documentation [</span><a href="#UCDDoc"><span>UCDDoc</span></a><span>].</span></p>
