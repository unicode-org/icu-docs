<pre>public class <span class="typeNameLabel">RuleBasedNumberFormat</span>
extends <a href="../../../../com/ibm/icu/text/NumberFormat.html" title="class in com.ibm.icu.text">NumberFormat</a></pre>
<div class="block"><p>A class that formats numbers according to a set of rules. This number formatter is
 typically used for spelling out numeric values in words (e.g., 25,3476 as
 &quot;twenty-five thousand three hundred seventy-six&quot; or &quot;vingt-cinq mille trois
 cents soixante-seize&quot; or
 &quot;funfundzwanzigtausenddreihundertsechsundsiebzig&quot;), but can also be used for
 other complicated formatting tasks, such as formatting a number of seconds as hours,
 minutes and seconds (e.g., 3,730 as &quot;1:02:10&quot;).</p>

 <p>The resources contain three predefined formatters for each locale: spellout, which
 spells out a value in words (123 is &quot;one hundred twenty-three&quot;); ordinal, which
 appends an ordinal suffix to the end of a numeral (123 is &quot;123rd&quot;); and
 duration, which shows a duration in seconds as hours, minutes, and seconds (123 is
 &quot;2:03&quot;).&nbsp; The client can also define more specialized <tt>RuleBasedNumberFormat</tt>s
 by supplying programmer-defined rule sets.</p>

 <p>The behavior of a <tt>RuleBasedNumberFormat</tt> is specified by a textual description
 that is either passed to the constructor as a <tt>String</tt> or loaded from a resource
 bundle. In its simplest form, the description consists of a semicolon-delimited list of <em>rules.</em>
 Each rule has a string of output text and a value or range of values it is applicable to.
 In a typical spellout rule set, the first twenty rules are the words for the numbers from
 0 to 19:</p>

 <pre>zero; one; two; three; four; five; six; seven; eight; nine;
 ten; eleven; twelve; thirteen; fourteen; fifteen; sixteen; seventeen; eighteen; nineteen;</pre>

 <p>For larger numbers, we can use the preceding set of rules to format the ones place, and
 we only have to supply the words for the multiples of 10:</p>

 <pre>20: twenty[-&gt;&gt;];
 30: thirty{-&gt;&gt;];
 40: forty[-&gt;&gt;];
 50: fifty[-&gt;&gt;];
 60: sixty[-&gt;&gt;];
 70: seventy[-&gt;&gt;];
 80: eighty[-&gt;&gt;];
 90: ninety[-&gt;&gt;];</pre>

 <p>In these rules, the <em>base value</em> is spelled out explicitly and set off from the
 rule's output text with a colon. The rules are in a sorted list, and a rule is applicable
 to all numbers from its own base value to one less than the next rule's base value. The
 &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; token is called a <em>substitution</em> and tells the formatter to
 isolate the number's ones digit, format it using this same set of rules, and place the
 result at the position of the &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; token. Text in brackets is omitted if
 the number being formatted is an even multiple of 10 (the hyphen is a literal hyphen; 24
 is &quot;twenty-four,&quot; not &quot;twenty four&quot;).</p>

 <p>For even larger numbers, we can actually look up several parts of the number in the
 list:</p>

 <pre>100: &lt;&lt; hundred[ &gt;&gt;];</pre>

 <p>The &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; represents a new kind of substitution. The &lt;&lt; isolates
 the hundreds digit (and any digits to its left), formats it using this same rule set, and
 places the result where the &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; was. Notice also that the meaning of
 &gt;&gt; has changed: it now refers to both the tens and the ones digits. The meaning of
 both substitutions depends on the rule's base value. The base value determines the rule's <em>divisor,</em>
 which is the highest power of 10 that is less than or equal to the base value (the user
 can change this). To fill in the substitutions, the formatter divides the number being
 formatted by the divisor. The integral quotient is used to fill in the &lt;&lt;
 substitution, and the remainder is used to fill in the &gt;&gt; substitution. The meaning
 of the brackets changes similarly: text in brackets is omitted if the value being
 formatted is an even multiple of the rule's divisor. The rules are applied recursively, so
 if a substitution is filled in with text that includes another substitution, that
 substitution is also filled in.</p>

 <p>This rule covers values up to 999, at which point we add another rule:</p>

 <pre>1000: &lt;&lt; thousand[ &gt;&gt;];</pre>

 <p>Again, the meanings of the brackets and substitution tokens shift because the rule's
 base value is a higher power of 10, changing the rule's divisor. This rule can actually be
 used all the way up to 999,999. This allows us to finish out the rules as follows:</p>

 <pre>1,000,000: &lt;&lt; million[ &gt;&gt;];
 1,000,000,000: &lt;&lt; billion[ &gt;&gt;];
 1,000,000,000,000: &lt;&lt; trillion[ &gt;&gt;];
 1,000,000,000,000,000: OUT OF RANGE!;</pre>

 <p>Commas, periods, and spaces can be used in the base values to improve legibility and
 are ignored by the rule parser. The last rule in the list is customarily treated as an
 &quot;overflow rule,&quot; applying to everything from its base value on up, and often (as
 in this example) being used to print out an error message or default representation.
 Notice also that the size of the major groupings in large numbers is controlled by the
 spacing of the rules: because in English we group numbers by thousand, the higher rules
 are separated from each other by a factor of 1,000.</p>

 <p>To see how these rules actually work in practice, consider the following example:
 Formatting 25,430 with this rule set would work like this:</p>

 <table border="0" width="630">
   <tr>
     <td style="width: 21;"></td>
     <td style="width: 257; vertical-align: top;"><strong>&lt;&lt; thousand &gt;&gt;</strong></td>
     <td style="width: 340; vertical-align: top;">[the rule whose base value is 1,000 is applicable to 25,340]</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td style="width: 21;"></td>
     <td style="width: 257; vertical-align: top;"><strong>twenty-&gt;&gt;</strong> thousand &gt;&gt;</td>
     <td style="width: 340; vertical-align: top;">[25,340 over 1,000 is 25. The rule for 20 applies.]</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td style="width: 21;"></td>
     <td style="width: 257; vertical-align: top;">twenty-<strong>five</strong> thousand &gt;&gt;</td>
     <td style="width: 340; vertical-align: top;">[25 mod 10 is 5. The rule for 5 is &quot;five.&quot;</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td style="width: 21;"></td>
     <td style="width: 257; vertical-align: top;">twenty-five thousand <strong>&lt;&lt; hundred &gt;&gt;</strong></td>
     <td style="width: 340; vertical-align: top;">[25,340 mod 1,000 is 340. The rule for 100 applies.]</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td style="width: 21;"></td>
     <td style="width: 257; vertical-align: top;">twenty-five thousand <strong>three</strong> hundred &gt;&gt;</td>
     <td style="width: 340; vertical-align: top;">[340 over 100 is 3. The rule for 3 is &quot;three.&quot;]</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td style="width: 21;"></td>
     <td style="width: 257; vertical-align: top;">twenty-five thousand three hundred <strong>forty</strong></td>
     <td style="width: 340; vertical-align: top;">[340 mod 100 is 40. The rule for 40 applies. Since 40 divides
     evenly by 10, the hyphen and substitution in the brackets are omitted.]</td>
   </tr>
 </table>

 <p>The above syntax suffices only to format positive integers. To format negative numbers,
 we add a special rule:</p>

 <pre>-x: minus &gt;&gt;;</pre>

 <p>This is called a <em>negative-number rule,</em> and is identified by &quot;-x&quot;
 where the base value would be. This rule is used to format all negative numbers. the
 &gt;&gt; token here means &quot;find the number's absolute value, format it with these
 rules, and put the result here.&quot;</p>

 <p>We also add a special rule called a <em>fraction rule </em>for numbers with fractional
 parts:</p>

 <pre>x.x: &lt;&lt; point &gt;&gt;;</pre>

 <p>This rule is used for all positive non-integers (negative non-integers pass through the
 negative-number rule first and then through this rule). Here, the &lt;&lt; token refers to
 the number's integral part, and the &gt;&gt; to the number's fractional part. The
 fractional part is formatted as a series of single-digit numbers (e.g., 123.456 would be
 formatted as &quot;one hundred twenty-three point four five six&quot;).</p>

 <p>To see how this rule syntax is applied to various languages, examine the resource data.</p>

 <p>There is actually much more flexibility built into the rule language than the
 description above shows. A formatter may own multiple rule sets, which can be selected by
 the caller, and which can use each other to fill in their substitutions. Substitutions can
 also be filled in with digits, using a DecimalFormat object. There is syntax that can be
 used to alter a rule's divisor in various ways. And there is provision for much more
 flexible fraction handling. A complete description of the rule syntax follows:</p>

 <hr>

 <p>The description of a <tt>RuleBasedNumberFormat</tt>'s behavior consists of one or more <em>rule
 sets.</em> Each rule set consists of a name, a colon, and a list of <em>rules.</em> A rule
 set name must begin with a % sign. Rule sets with names that begin with a single % sign
 are <em>public:</em> the caller can specify that they be used to format and parse numbers.
 Rule sets with names that begin with %% are <em>private:</em> they exist only for the use
 of other rule sets. If a formatter only has one rule set, the name may be omitted.</p>

 <p>The user can also specify a special &quot;rule set&quot; named <tt>%%lenient-parse</tt>.
 The body of <tt>%%lenient-parse</tt> isn't a set of number-formatting rules, but a <tt>RuleBasedCollator</tt>
 description which is used to define equivalences for lenient parsing. For more information
 on the syntax, see <tt>RuleBasedCollator</tt>. For more information on lenient parsing,
 see <tt>setLenientParse()</tt>. <em>Note:</em> symbols that have syntactic meaning
 in collation rules, such as '&amp;', have no particular meaning when appearing outside
 of the <tt>lenient-parse</tt> rule set.</p>

 <p>The body of a rule set consists of an ordered, semicolon-delimited list of <em>rules.</em>
 Internally, every rule has a base value, a divisor, rule text, and zero, one, or two <em>substitutions.</em>
 These parameters are controlled by the description syntax, which consists of a <em>rule
 descriptor,</em> a colon, and a <em>rule body.</em></p>

 <p>A rule descriptor can take one of the following forms (text in <em>italics</em> is the
 name of a token):</p>

 <table border="0" width="100%">

     number expressed using ASCII digits. <em>bv</em> may contain spaces, period, and commas,

     the base value.</td>

 <p>A rule set may be either a regular rule set or a <em>fraction rule set,</em> depending
 on whether it is used to format a number's integral part (or the whole number) or a
 number's fractional part. Using a rule set to format a rule's fractional part makes it a
 fraction rule set.</p>

 <p>Which rule is used to format a number is defined according to one of the following
 algorithms: If the rule set is a regular rule set, do the following:

 <ul>
   <li>If the rule set includes a master rule (and the number was passed in as a <tt>double</tt>),
     use the master rule.&nbsp; (If the number being formatted was passed in as a <tt>long</tt>,
     the master rule is ignored.)</li>
   <li>If the number is negative, use the negative-number rule.</li>
   <li>If the number has a fractional part and is greater than 1, use the improper fraction
     rule.</li>
   <li>If the number has a fractional part and is between 0 and 1, use the proper fraction
     rule.</li>
   <li>Binary-search the rule list for the rule with the highest base value less than or equal
     to the number. If that rule has two substitutions, its base value is not an even multiple
     of its divisor, and the number <em>is</em> an even multiple of the rule's divisor, use the
     rule that precedes it in the rule list. Otherwise, use the rule itself.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>If the rule set is a fraction rule set, do the following:

 <ul>
   <li>Ignore negative-number and fraction rules.</li>
   <li>For each rule in the list, multiply the number being formatted (which will always be
     between 0 and 1) by the rule's base value. Keep track of the distance between the result
     the nearest integer.</li>
   <li>Use the rule that produced the result closest to zero in the above calculation. In the
     event of a tie or a direct hit, use the first matching rule encountered. (The idea here is
     to try each rule's base value as a possible denominator of a fraction. Whichever
     denominator produces the fraction closest in value to the number being formatted wins.) If
     the rule following the matching rule has the same base value, use it if the numerator of
     the fraction is anything other than 1; if the numerator is 1, use the original matching
     rule. (This is to allow singular and plural forms of the rule text without a lot of extra
     hassle.)</li>
 </ul>

 <p>A rule's body consists of a string of characters terminated by a semicolon. The rule
 may include zero, one, or two <em>substitution tokens,</em> and a range of text in
 brackets. The brackets denote optional text (and may also include one or both
 substitutions). The exact meanings of the substitution tokens, and under what conditions
 optional text is omitted, depend on the syntax of the substitution token and the context.
 The rest of the text in a rule body is literal text that is output when the rule matches
 the number being formatted.</p>

 <p>A substitution token begins and ends with a <em>token character.</em> The token
 character and the context together specify a mathematical operation to be performed on the
 number being formatted. An optional <em>substitution descriptor </em>specifies how the
 value resulting from that operation is used to fill in the substitution. The position of
 the substitution token in the rule body specifies the location of the resultant text in
 the original rule text.</p>

 <p>The substitution descriptor (i.e., the text between the token characters) may take one
 of three forms:</p>

 <table border="0" width="100%">
   <tr>
     <td style="width: 42;"></td>
     <td style="width: 166; vertical-align: top;">a rule set name</td>

     DecimalFormat with the specified pattern.&nbsp; The pattern must begin with 0 or #.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td style="width: 166; vertical-align: top;">nothing</td>
     <td>Perform the mathematical operation on the number, and format the result using the rule
     set containing the current rule, except:<ul>
       <li>You can't have an empty substitution descriptor with a == substitution.</li>
       <li>If you omit the substitution descriptor in a &gt;&gt; substitution in a fraction rule,
         format the result one digit at a time using the rule set containing the current rule.</li>
       <li>If you omit the substitution descriptor in a &lt;&lt; substitution in a rule in a
         fraction rule set, format the result using the default rule set for this formatter.</li>
     </ul>
     </td>
   </tr>
 </table>

 <p>Whitespace is ignored between a rule set name and a rule set body, between a rule
 descriptor and a rule body, or between rules. If a rule body begins with an apostrophe,
 the apostrophe is ignored, but all text after it becomes significant (this is how you can
 have a rule's rule text begin with whitespace). There is no escape function: the semicolon
 is not allowed in rule set names or in rule text, and the colon is not allowed in rule set
 names. The characters beginning a substitution token are always treated as the beginning
 of a substitution token.</p>

 <p>See the resource data and the demo program for annotated examples of real rule sets
 using these features.</p></div>
