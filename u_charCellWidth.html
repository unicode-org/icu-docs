Returns a value indicating the display-cell width of the character
when used in Asian text, according to the Unicode standard (see p. 6-130
of The Unicode Standard, Version 2.0).  The results for various characters
are as follows:
<P>
ZERO_WIDTH: Characters which are considered to take up no display-cell space:
control characters
format characters
line and paragraph separators
non-spacing marks
combining Hangul jungseong
combining Hangul jongseong
unassigned Unicode values
<P>
HALF_WIDTH: Characters which take up half a cell in standard Asian text:
all characters in the General Scripts Area except combining Hangul choseong
and the characters called out specifically above as ZERO_WIDTH
alphabetic and Arabic presentation forms
halfwidth CJK punctuation
halfwidth Katakana
halfwidth Hangul Jamo
halfwidth forms, arrows, and shapes
<P>
FULL_WIDTH:  Characters which take up a full cell in standard Asian text:
combining Hangul choseong
all characters in the CJK Phonetics and Symbols Area
all characters in the CJK Ideographs Area
all characters in the Hangul Syllables Area
CJK compatibility ideographs
CJK compatibility forms
small form variants
fullwidth ASCII
fullwidth punctuation and currency signs
<P>
NEUTRAL:  Characters whose cell width is context-dependent:
all characters in the Symbols Area, except those specifically called out above
all characters in the Surrogates Area
all charcaters in the Private Use Area
<P>
For Korean text, this algorithm should work properly with properly normalized Korean
text.  Precomposed Hangul syllables and non-combining jamo are all considered full-
width characters.  For combining jamo, we treat we treat choseong (initial consonants)
as double-width characters and junseong (vowels) and jongseong (final consonants)
as non-spacing marks.  This will work right in text that uses the precomposed
choseong characters instead of teo choseong characters in a row, and which uses the
choseong filler character at the beginning of syllables that don't have an initial
consonant.  The results may be slightly off with Korean text following different
conventions.
