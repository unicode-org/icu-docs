Agenda Items:

- Markus: Renaming Vs Namespaces for ICU versioning
  + Markus: Gave a brief overview of the current renaming and Namespace approach.
  + Helena: Gave an update on the progress of prototype which wraps ICU classes
    in ICU_$(VERSION) namespace
  + Yves: getMemory internal method is being renamed. 
  + Helena: All the internal C functions should be prefixed with uprv_. 
    Problem acknowledged and will be fixed.
  + Yves: There is a huge chance for conflicts even for C functions. It may cause problems.
  + Yves: It should be possible to automatically generate a list of funtions that are 
    internal and donot have uprv_ prefix. Another script to automatically rename these functions.
  + Vladimir: Pleae summarise the idea in an email.
  + Yves: Timeframe for prototype.
  + Helena: Very soon

- Yves: Need a way to plug in older Unicode data into ICU.
  + Yves: What would be the best way to plug in the old version of Unicode data into ICU.
  + Markus: New properties trie format is being designed with support for iswhitespace etc., 
    would address the concern. After 2.0 timeframe. The basic idea is use 1 trie structure 
    to plugin properties dynamically.
  + Yves: Can Unicode 2.1 data files be used.
  + Markus: Some services like Normalization may have problem functioning correctly with old data, since 
    the properties have changed considerably and should be looked into.
  + Helena: Tex, are you supporting Unicode 2.1 in your produdcts
  + Tex: we are supporting 2.1. There has been no real demand for later versions of Unicode
  + Tex: GB18030: Is China enfocing the encoding or conversion support.
  + Helena: China is not enforcing to the extent that products have to removed from the shelf. More importantly
    the locale naming issues have forced removal of productsd off the shelf.
